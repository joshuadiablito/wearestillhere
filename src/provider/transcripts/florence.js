My name is Florence Obadeyi. I&rsquo;m 49 years old, I&rsquo;ll be 50 next year and I&rsquo;m half-Nigerian, half-Jamaican and I&rsquo;ve been living with HIV since 1999, so that&rsquo;s 21 years ago I was diagnosed with HIV. And I have a son who is 20 years old. He lives in Hull. He lives in </p>
<p>
London and I live in Hull.
Home is this country. Although I was born in Nigeria - and my father was Nigerian and my mother was Jamaican - I came to the UK in 1997 and I&rsquo;ve lived in the UK ever since. I lived in London for fifteen years so home was London for a long time, but then I married my husband and he&rsquo;s from Hull. He&rsquo;s from Willerby, near Hull, and so we decided to come and live in Hull and home is Hull now for me and, yeah&</p>
<p>
hellip; Home is Hull.
My home is home because I&rsquo;ve got my two cats. I&rsquo;ve got Pinky who&rsquo;s a confident cat that goes out and comes back into the house. I&rsquo;ve got Chelsea that is not so confident, who likes to stay in the house. I live with my husband at the moment. My son lives in London, so he&rsquo;s not with us. So home is&hellip; What makes home for is my husband really, he&rsquo;s the only one. And the cats. Yeah, my husband is nice, gentle man and I&rsquo;m very happy with him. We have a really good relationship, we&rsquo;re very close and we do things together. In my house, when you come in to my house you will see lots of fishing objects because my husband likes to fish. He does it as a hobby. In the garden, we have, my husband, he&rsquo;s got a motorbike. So he likes going biking and I sit on the back of the bike and we do that in the summer and so I enjoy doing that. We go, he&rsquo;s part of a group, a few different groups, that go on rides. They just meet at a certain location and then go off and ride into the countryside for hours and hours and hours so&hellip; Yeah, so you see that in my home my kitchen is full of vegan food because I&rsquo;m vegan. I&rsquo;ve been vegan for about fifteen years now. I was vegetarian for&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been vegetarian for about twenty years but vegan for about fifteen years. My husband, when I met him, tricked me into letting me think he&rsquo;s changing to becoming a vegan but then we got married and moved into Hulll, moved into the house and we&rsquo;re living together he suddenly now, suddenly say, demanding chicken and meat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bored, I want chicken, I want meat.&rdquo; So, I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m not a very strict vegan. I&rsquo;m strict with myself but I allow other people to choose what they want to do. So my husband has meat. He cooks chicken and everything, so he does that. He&rsquo;s a good cook, he used to be a chef so he&rsquo;s a good cook. So he cooks his own food and sometimes he eats what I cook, my vegan meals as well. So you find that in my </p>
<p>
kitchen.
Upstairs in my bedroom, you&rsquo;ll find all my clothes. I&rsquo;ve got lots of wigs because I&rsquo;m African and we like to wear extensions. I&rsquo;ve got lots of wigs! My husband say &ldquo;...no, no, you&rsquo;ve got enough wigs, not another one!&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve got short ones, I&rsquo;ve got long ones. Also, I have lots of clothes. I&rsquo;ve got casual clothes, I&rsquo;ve got clothes I like to wear when we&rsquo;re going out in the evenings for a meal, although with COVID now I&rsquo;ve not been able to dress up and go anywhere so I just wear my jeans and my jumpers when I&rsquo;m at home. What else? Yeah, my son&rsquo;s room is vacant at the moment because he&rsquo;s living in London. He left home when he was eighteen, he went to university and his room has just been empty since. So fingers crossed, we&rsquo;re not sure, we have plans for the future. We might be thinking of maybe fostering or adoption or anything, something like that, yeah? But we&rsquo;re not sure yet. And then, in terms of HIV, the only evidence of HIV in my home will be my medication so I keep my medication upstairs. Just on my sidetable and my husband keeps his on the sidetable as well, so we don&rsquo;t need to hide our medication we&rsquo;re very open about it. We don&rsquo;t often have many visitors because Hull is very quiet. We tend to go and visit people more. There&rsquo;s a Nigerian community in Hull and I&rsquo;m part of that community. There&rsquo;s a Nigerian restaurant, we go there once in a while, just for a different vibe &lsquo;cause there&rsquo;s Nigerian music and there&rsquo;s Nigerian food and things. So, I think that&rsquo;s all I can say about my home. I&rsquo;d love to have a bigger house. So, I&rsquo;m working towards that. So I can have a walk-in wardrobe, I&rsquo;d like that! So, I&rsquo;m really looking forward to hopefully moving to a </p>
<p>
bigger house in the future.
Before my diagnosis my plan was to come to the UK, maybe work for a while, make some money and then try to relocate back to Nigeria. But that&rsquo;s totally changed, because when I got diagnosed I just knew there was no way I would survive in Africa so, and, I have a long story about that because when I was diagnosed my visa was running out, so I had to quickly find a solicitor to apply for asylum for me and we put in an application in two-thousand-and&hellip; 2000, and I didn&rsquo;t get a reply &lsquo;til 2010, when eventually I was given a &lsquo;leave-to-remain&rsquo;. So for ten years I was living as an asylum seeker and I only got forty pounds for myself, twenty pounds for my son, because my son&rsquo;s dad left us when I was pregnant when I told him&hellip; I told him I was diagnosed with HIV and that was the last I saw of him. So I brought up my son by myself &lsquo;til I met my husband now and my husband now is like a dad to my son. But for those ten years I couldn&rsquo;t work. So what I did&hellip; Not long after I got diagnosed, in fact the week I got diagnosed, I rang up HIV charity Positively UK, used to be Positive Women in those days and I spoke to someone that invited me to support groups and I went to support groups and that increased my confidence and so I started volunteering, any opportunity I had to volunteer casually. It was a bit difficult having a child &lsquo;cause I had childcare issues. But whenever I had the opportunity, like when he was in school, I would go and volunteer. So, it was really difficult. Very difficult. But the good thing I did was volunteering because it&rsquo;s also helped my application to the Home Office because it showed that once I get the right-to-work, work permit, I will not be on benefit, I will be working and that&rsquo;s exactly what I did. Since 2010, when I was granted &lsquo;leave-to-remain&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ve been working as a carer and I&rsquo;ve not </p>
<p>
stopped since then.
Yeah, I missed home a lot. A lot of things happened, actually. My Mum died. She died in&hellip; She died in&hellip; That was&hellip; She died in 1998, so I couldn&rsquo;t go home to see her, to bury her, yeah. I couldn&rsquo;t attend her funeral and then my Dad died in 2005. So I lost both parents and I never went to their funerals. I sent money home. I made sure that they had enough money to have a good funeral at home but my brother went home, my sister went home, but I couldn&rsquo;t go. And that&rsquo;s because if I&rsquo;d gone back home I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to come back to the UK and with HIV I couldn&rsquo;t, just couldn&rsquo;t, it was just too much risk. So, if I&hellip; Because I&rsquo;d put an application in to the Home Office to say that it&rsquo;s not safe for me to live in Nigeria with HIV. I couldn&rsquo;t go there and trust it&rsquo;s not safe. I might not be able to get my medication, and stigma is really bad in Nigeria and things like that. So that changed for me, so home&hellip; After, once I was diagnosed I just knew I was going to have to live in the UK &lsquo;til I die, really, and that&rsquo;s what I plan to do now. And also, my son is born in the UK, he&rsquo;s born in London, he&rsquo;s a Londoner. I&rsquo;ve got nowhere to go. I have to stay where he can find me, see me easily. Africa is just too far away. And I&rsquo;m really grateful for all the help and the support I&rsquo;ve got through the Government and I&rsquo;m really grateful I get free medication and I&rsquo;m able to take care of myself. I&rsquo;m </p>
<p>
really appreciating all of that.
When I was diagnosed with HIV I decided to tell one of my ex-partners. I rang him up. I preferred to do it on the phone, so I rang him up and I said &ldquo;&hellip; oh please, I&rsquo;ve just been diagnosed with HIV, please go and have an HIV test done.&rdquo; He turned around to me and said: &ldquo;Florence, if I have a test done, if it&rsquo;s positive, I&rsquo;m going to get a gun and I&rsquo;m going to shoot you.&rdquo; And that was a big shock. That really scared me. That was in London where there&rsquo;s gun crime, there&rsquo;s knife crime. So, I&hellip; Luckily went and tested and came back negative and came back and told me on the phone, called me and told me on the phone that he&rsquo;s negative. I didn&rsquo;t think, you know, I didn&rsquo;t feel safe around him, so I kept away from him. And then when I told the father of my son as well, he kept in touch with me from&hellip; &lsquo;Til my son had his last test, when he was eighteen months, to prove that... his tests to show that he was negative, just to make sure he didn&rsquo;t pick up the virus from me. And that was the last time I heard from him and then he changed his number and his number was just gone. I had no contact for him and so I&rsquo;ve had to bring my son up without him. So, that&rsquo;s a bad </p>
<p>
experience.
And for the first ten years, when I was trying to date, get a partner, I told people and they&rsquo;ll just stop calling or stop picking up my calls. They&hellip; The relationship was&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t build a relationship. People were too scared, you know, of HIV. And we did not have, in the first ten years of my life living with HIV, we didn&rsquo;t have the information about U=U, about undetectable equals untransmittable, which means if you are on medication there&rsquo;s no way you can pass the virus on. So, now I feel more confident because I know that I have that to back me. I have that research, evidence to back me. That I&rsquo;m not infectious. </p>
<p>
I cannot pass on HIV. Yeah, so...
Positive experiences I&rsquo;ve had living with HIV&hellip; I&rsquo;ve told people and, okay, I told a friend and she just, she doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a big deal, she just thinks, oh, she&rsquo;s so nice and she&rsquo;s an American and she just says to me &ldquo;&hellip; why don&rsquo;t people just read things up on the internet? It&rsquo;s there on the internet.&rdquo; &lsquo;Cause when I told her about U&hellip; When U=U came out, so when you can&rsquo;t pass it on if you&rsquo;re taking medication, when that was&hellip; They proved that, medical doctors and medical professionals decided to tell people that actually, you cannot pass it on. And I told her that and she said, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s on the internet!&rdquo; &lsquo;cause she looked at it and she saw it and she read it. So, she&rsquo;s been nice. She&rsquo;s okay. And there was another one I told, she&rsquo;s English, she was very nice and she still is very nice. Both of them are still my friends. I told a potential partner as well and he&rsquo;s been okay about it, he&rsquo;s alright about it. That&hellip; I knew him before I met my husband and I told him before I met&hellip; So this was going back to 2005, 2006, that time&hellip; And I&rsquo;ve gained a lot of skills from volunteering, in my HIV. The public speaking I do with my HIV, with THT Positive Voices, that has built my confidence. Now I know how to speak to a crowd of people. And I can tell them my story, so that&rsquo;s positive. And my son knows that I&rsquo;m doing all these things so that&rsquo;s all very good for him, as well. So he sees me as a positive role-model. And I&rsquo;m hoping that it helps him cope with knowing that his Mum lives with HIV. I asked him the other day, I said, I told my son when he was five, and, but when I told him I had to say to him as well, I had to say to him, I said: &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go and share Mum&rsquo;s health condition,&rdquo; and I explained the reasons why because I&rsquo;d already spoken to him about sex, that&rsquo;s where babies come from, so it wasn&rsquo;t that difficult to explain it. And he did keep it quiet, he didn&rsquo;t tell anyone. But the good side, the good thing about that was when he was growing up with me, when we were back in London, we used to go to support groups a lot. Those support groups really helped him a lot because I told him, I said: &ldquo;Remember, all those are your friends in the creche.&rdquo; Because when we go to support groups they had creches for the children and I said: &ldquo;Their Mum have all got &ndash; Mum and Dad &ndash; have got HIV,&rdquo; and he says &ldquo;&hellip; oh really?&rdquo; First time I told him he was really surprised and I think that gave him confidence, so now when I&rsquo;ve asked him, when he&rsquo;s twenty now and living in London and I asked him and I said: &ldquo;Have you told any of your friends?&rdquo; And yes, one day he was drunk, he told his friends and everyone was sorry for him. So, so that&rsquo;s been positive. I think living with HIV has given me confidence as well. I&rsquo;m determined. I&rsquo;ve got determination. Yeah, I want to achieve in life and I&rsquo;m trying to do things that achieve in life, yeah. </p>
<p>
Definitely.
My family members&hellip; for a long time I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on when I was living in London with my son as a single Mum. I just noticed that every time I told my sister she was like &ldquo;...oh, so so so Auntie at the party, so so so niece at the party, so so so nephew at the party,&rdquo; and I just used to think &lsquo;&hellip; oh, maybe she just thinks I&rsquo;m not that age group that&rsquo;s why she never invited me.&rsquo; It took me a while to realise that she wasn&rsquo;t inviting me to parties because of the HIV. I was an embarrassment to the family. The worst one she did, when she was turning fifty, she told me, two weeks to the birthday party, and it&rsquo;s not just a small birthday party it was in a hall so you can&rsquo;t plan that in two weeks. And my brother was flying down from Ireland, as well. Before all that, my relationship with my brother was better, with my sister&hellip; It&rsquo;s always been a bit dodgy with my sister because she didn&rsquo;t live at home when I was growing up, but I always tried to make amends of that by overlooking the fact that maybe she treated me not very nice sometimes. But yeah&hellip; And my cousins, when I told my cousin&hellip; I used to go and sleep over at her place. Now, every time when I call her and say &ldquo;Can I come?&rdquo; she gives me an excuse. Yeah. So many things </p>
<p>
like that, yeah. Definitely.
HIV definitely has affected certain, certain spaces in my life, yeah. Yes. Definitely it did. For a long time, &lsquo;til I met my husband. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m very close to my husband because we both know what we&rsquo;re going through. My husband was diagnosed in the &lsquo;80s and he was going to die. So, it was just when medication came out and they gave him medication and that saved him. But he actually had tuberculosis so he was very ill and, did he have... He had shingles as well, so&hellip; But he&rsquo;s been well since then. Yeah, so we support each other. I get my support from him. It&rsquo;s&hellip; again, like I said, my confidence has grown but before I met him it was difficult when I met people and I was going to date them. I had to say to them at one point, I had to say to them &ldquo;&hellip; I&rsquo;m living with HIV,&rdquo; and like I said in the past, early on, it just broke the relationship. It just did not work. I think people are just too scared, people don&rsquo;t seem to really understand the way it&rsquo;s transmitted. They still think it&rsquo;s like COVID, like you can get from sitting next to the person I&rsquo;m talking. Or you can get from sharing cutleries and things like that. People are scared. I think the Government should have on telly adverts, like they have for diabetes, for high blood pressure, for heart disease, there should be something modern and relevant to this age, about HIV, they should. Because people are going out&hellip; There are a lot of people out there that have not been diagnosed, don&rsquo;t know that they have the virus and they&rsquo;re passing it to their loved ones, all the time, it&rsquo;s happening every day. So it would be cheaper for the Government to actually have adverts or a campaign out. It&rsquo;s cheaper in the </p>
<p>
long run than having people on medication.
I&rsquo;ve got the vegan community and, at one point, when my son had some problems at primary school, I home-schooled him, so there&rsquo;s a&hellip; I have a whole group of home-schoolers in London&hellip; I&rsquo;ve kind of lost touch with some of them but I used to be a part of that community. Yeah, I&rsquo;m definitely of the HIV-community. Yeah, the HIV-community is a big one for me. I&rsquo;ve got lots of friends from all over the world. The beautiful thing about HIV is that it&rsquo;s spread all over the world so I&rsquo;ve got friends from Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, you know&hellip; Nigeria, as well, but definitely from other parts of the country </p>
<p>
as well - of the World - as well.
I think being with my husband... Yeah, I trust him. He&rsquo;s very trustworthy. We have clashes sometimes because sometimes he&rsquo;s just being a man and he can&rsquo;t connect to emotional side of things sometimes, but yeah, he&rsquo;s my&hellip; He&rsquo;s my rock really, yeah. Since I met him. I&rsquo;ve been able to achieve a </p>
<p>
lot of things since I met him. Yeah.
I would describe myself as caring, loving, understanding, open-minded. I&rsquo;m interested in other people&rsquo;s cultures. And respected. I&rsquo;m an atheist, I don&rsquo;t believe in God, but my family don&rsquo;t know that but they&rsquo;ll probably find out now! Yeah, I like to dress up, I like to take care of myself. I like to be well-presented. I&rsquo;m reliable, so if I say I&rsquo;m going to do something I try to stick to it. I don&rsquo;t let people down. I am good at organising things, so I&rsquo;m quite organised. My house might look like I&rsquo;ve got a lot of things but if you look at the things they&rsquo;re all arranged. So, I&rsquo;m tidy. I like a tidy space. I&rsquo;m colourful, I like colours. When I dress up I like to wear bright colours. I don&rsquo;t really like wearing black. I like to wear red, green, blue, nice yellow colours. I like glitter. I&rsquo;ve got a glitter bag, I&rsquo;ve got glitter shoes, I&rsquo;ve got glitter&hellip; Sequins dresses. I like glitter. My favourite time of the year is this time of the year, Christmas-time. I like Christmas a lot. It brings back good memories of when I was growing up. &lsquo;Cause when I was growing up, Christmas-time, my family, everybody would come home. Grandmother, auntie, uncle, niece, nephew, we&rsquo;ll all come together and have a big meal together, so&hellip; I&rsquo;m not able to achieve that here but I still celebrate Christmas so I have my lights up, I have my my tree up. Cook special Christmas dinner. I&rsquo;ve adopted a lot of the English culture. The thing is, being half-Nigerian and half-Jamaican was a&hellip; Has been a challenge so far. I can understand that with my son as well because he&rsquo;s half-Nigerian and half-English, or British. So, the Nigerians, when I clashed with them, or when I had a disagreement with them when I was living with them in Nigeria they&rsquo;ll turn &lsquo;round and say to me: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not even a Nigerian!&rdquo; Because my Mother was a Jamaican. And then when I came to the UK, and I met&hellip; I actually dated a Jamaican. The man who said he was going to get a gun and shoot me was a Jamaican and I dated him and&hellip; But he always used to see me as, like, I&rsquo;m African, I&rsquo;m not Jamaican as him. So somehow the Jamaicans didn&rsquo;t really accept me either. So, I&rsquo;m just in between. So, I don&rsquo;t know. When I get my British passport I&rsquo;ll say I&rsquo;m British. So, it&rsquo;s complicated. I understand what my son is going through now. Because he&rsquo;s mixed race, he&rsquo;s neither here or there. He&rsquo;s mixed-race, that&rsquo;s what he is. I&rsquo;m mixed-culture, as well. Same race, same black race, but the culture is different. I picked up a lot of Nigerian behaviours, the good ones, the good behaviours, like respecting all the people, being kind and caring to strangers and things like that. I picked all that up. And then from my Mum I picked up the food, rice and peas, ackee and salt fish - I don&rsquo;t eat that now &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m vegan &ndash; ginger beer, curry, yeah, so I picked up the food and a bit of the culture as well. And I&rsquo;m open-minded when it comes to music. I like music a lot. I like music and I&rsquo;m very open-minded when it comes to music. So anything that sounds good, yeah. My husband is into rock, rock music. And I didn&rsquo;t know I was into rock music &lsquo;til I met him. Because when he puts on the channel on MTV, and puts it on rock, I&rsquo;m singing to all the songs. I&rsquo;m looking at him and thinking &lsquo;&hellip; oh, so?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s actually&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t recognise it when I was growing up, that it was rock music, I just thought it was music and I just enjoyed it. So, yeah, I enjoyed that. Because he&rsquo;s a biker, we&rsquo;ve been going to, he&rsquo;s been taking me to rallies, biking rallies and they have music there, as well. They play rock music and ones where they&rsquo;re banging their heads like&hellip; I actually really enjoyed it. So, I like, so I can like rock music, even... Reggae, I like reggae which is Jamaican. I like hip-hop, Nigerian hip-hop music. And I like music from the &lsquo;80s and the &lsquo;90s. Yeah, so I&</p>
<p>
rsquo;m very open-minded that way.
Just a little message to people to say that we can stop the stigma around HIV. And&hellip; People need to feel safe. When people get diagnosed their biggest fear is their safety, their personal safety actually. Can I walk on the streets and tell everyone I&rsquo;m HIV-positive without being attacked? And unfortunately in this world we&rsquo;re living in people are still&hellip; You can still get attacked and that shouldn&rsquo;t be happening in this day and age, especially with knowing that once you&rsquo;re on medication, effective medication, you can&rsquo;t pass it on. More people&hellip; We need to educate people more and that&rsquo;s why I enjoy going to schools and talking to people, talking to the children in schools because I know they will take it home, tell their parents, their parents will tell their family members and that way it will spread and if we can start with the young ones it will be easier for them to take it in as adults. So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to say and I&rsquo;d like to advise mothers living with HIV to try and tell their children when they are young because when they become teenagers they&rsquo;re dealing with all sorts of hormones and relationships and it&rsquo;s just too much for you to break that news as a teenager, that Mum or Dad is HIV-positive. I think the earlier they know&hellip; I never hid my medication from my son and that was how I told him actually. He asked me: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that medication?&rdquo; and I said: &ldquo;Oh, actually, you remember the programme we watched on telly about HIV?&rdquo; &lsquo;Cause we watched a programme on telly and that&rsquo;s how I broke the news to him. He just laughed, he thought it was funny. And then after a few months he came back to me and said: &ldquo;Oh, do I have it?&rdquo; And I said: &ldquo;No. I told you. I explained to you. You don&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo; And then, he&rsquo;s been okay about it. Yeah, so we need to break the stigma so that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m just saying to people to please understand when someone living with HIV does not want to say they&rsquo;re living with HIV it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re protecting themselves. And their relationships. And their family members. And they don&rsquo;t want that stigma for their family members. So&hellip; Be kind to people living with HIV. Be supportive, just as you would support someone who has been diagnosed with cancer. That&rsquo;s the same way you should support someone living </p>
<p>
with HIV as well. Yeah. Thank you.
