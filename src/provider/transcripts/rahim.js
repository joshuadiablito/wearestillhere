<p>My name is Abderrahim El Habachi. I go by Rahim. Everyone knows me here as Rahim. I am originally from Morocco. I am 28 years old. Yeah, I live in Cardiff. I&rsquo;ve been living in Cardiff for&hellip; Actually, I&rsquo;ve been living in Wales for four years, in total. And, er, yeah. And actually the most important part I&rsquo;ve been living with HIV for eight years now. Okay. </p>
<p>So today actually we are in Bute Park which is the central park here in Cardiff. It&rsquo;s been around since centuries now and I always like find it peaceful to come here and just relax and do sometimes yoga or just meditate or read or, because it&rsquo;s like a walking distance from my house and&hellip; And actually this park was the first park I visited in Cardiff when I came here and I was like exploring the area and what-not and I found this amazing, magical, big park that was actually, you&rsquo;re in it. As a Moroccan we don&rsquo;t have enormous parks so, yeah&hellip; Especially greenery, it makes you feel calm and grounded. </p>
<p>I think home for me takes a lot of meanings as especially I&rsquo;m a refugee, so I had different homes and I had different amalgamation of that word. I think for me home at the beginning was next to my Mum, next to my brothers, having, having and getting along and having cooked meals and what-not but as I grew up and actually exploring my sexuality as well, a lot of that&hellip; The meaning of the word has changed so much, so when I was seventeen my home became outside of my house, which was supposed to be home. And home became me meeting my friends, my queer friends and like chatting without any, any fakeness and be myself and be who I am and I think that definition grew more and more and more, as I grew up. Until I decided actually to live, oh not to live, to leave the big home, which is Morocco, and then coming to Europe and find actually a safe home and with that safe home is also the community that comes with it, like what we say &lsquo;the chosen family&rsquo; and having that chosen family and feeling like supported, you safe and every version of the word makes me feel home. I dunno, this is a long definition of the word home but this is how I feel. </p>
<p>I think for me I&rsquo;m not materialistic as such, I can adapt in any environment or geology or whatever, weather-speaking, and&hellip; I get familiar with the place really easy, but I get bored when it&rsquo;s not like a community. For me, community equals home and I think I&rsquo;ve told this story so many times when I moved to the UK and&hellip; Because I was heartbroken because I came from the Netherlands. I choose that as my home and then the Netherlands were like: &lsquo;Okay, you have to go,&rsquo; because the law is, and I came to the UK and the UK was not even my first choice because I know nobody here, but literally &ndash; even when I was sent in Cardiff &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t know that it existed in the map, where it existed in the map, so&hellip; And then I started to like from depression locked-in my room for six months and then I started going out to meet new friends and build a community which was like for me at least I&rsquo;m lucky to have that capacity to have of building a community because I think that I&rsquo;m approachable and I speak too much and I speak with everyone and, so, it was easy for me to find a queer community here and bond with them and find home and then the Home Office decided to move me without any previous notice to another city. </p>
<p>I think I was so lucky to have only positive reactions, you know? And, so, like I told you, I&rsquo;m lucky to have&hellip; Okay, I&rsquo;m going to repeat. Because I said &lsquo;like I told you&rsquo; &hellip; So I was so lucky to have only positive reactions except from a couple that I don&rsquo;t like to mention because they are like just 1% in like 100% and I just remember, like, the first time I got diagnosed and the doctor told me: &ldquo;...you are living with HIV&rdquo;, the first thing I thought of was like: &lsquo;Oh my god, what am I going to say to my Mum?&rsquo; She&rsquo;s the first one that I thought of and luckily I have - I had, at least - I had a good relationship with my Aunt and she is the same age as me so I told her and she really reacted positively at first and she was crying but crying for the right reasons, not for the wrong reasons. And then we, and then she asked me: &ldquo;Can I tell it to the other sisters?&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;Yeah, sure.&rdquo; I have a big family, by the way, and she said, and I said: &ldquo;Yeah, sure, you can tell them,&rdquo; and she told them her way. And that made it easier for me. But, I made sure that I would be the one to tell it to my Mum. So when I told it to my Mum, I think I had this speech prepared, and that I&rsquo;m ready to leave the house if you want me to or what-not, and she was like: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I&rsquo;m just shocked, and I think you should be, it&rsquo;s natural to be shocked.&rdquo; And we had an open conversation that allowed me even to open up about my sexual orientation to her and why I am who I am and she asked like questions about that and this and this and this and that really really was really important and having the reaction of my family and the support of my family was amazing. That&rsquo;s why I think pushed me to go on TV, on national television and speak about it openly in Morocco, in 2014, and &lsquo;til this day it was my proudest moment&hellip; is not only to get the support of my family but also to bring light on people living with HIV because before I did it there was only people talking about it with hiding their faces and for me it was like I didn&rsquo;t do any crimes to hide my face, why are we hiding our faces? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going just to talk about it&hellip; Oh, probably because I was too young and reckless! And I thought: &lsquo;Ah, I&rsquo;ll do it!&rsquo; but I don&rsquo;t regret it because it was an amazing moment and a lot of people, &lsquo;til now, I did it in 2014 and we are now in 2021 and people are always reaching out to me on Instagram or Facebook or something like that who are newly-diagnosed and they&rsquo;re looking for answers and having that, someone who talks about it in a positive way, sharing his experience or sharing my experience in a positive way, even though there was some hiccups even though I choose to deliberately say the positive ones because I think it will create a snowball of only positivity, if someone&rsquo;s family saw me and her kid or her husband or her son or whatever and is like: &ldquo;Well, his mother accepted him, his sister accepted him, his brother accepted him, why on earth can I not accept my&hellip;&rdquo; So that was my, my, my idea of it. </p>
<p>But like, although that I have positive reactions, of course I had negative reactions and one of them is my older brother, who was literally: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; But, the reason is I didn&rsquo;t get to tell him myself. He learned it and he learned it the horrif- the horrifying way. I think if I had the chance for talking to him, sitting down with him and telling him that this has happened, this is why and this is who I am now. I don&rsquo;t think, I think he will shout at me or he will have a bad reaction but he will not be so dramatic. Because he&rsquo;s just stopped talking to me. Period. For two years, or three years, after that. And even though we were living in the same house, like we would cross paths, our eyes would not lock, and anything. And also another reaction, bad reaction that I had is from one of my closest friends, who, first of all, first of all I told my best best friends that I&rsquo;m living with HIV right away and they were amazing about it. They even went with me to the hospital to get my treatments and get everything done and they drove me there and they hold my hand and all that. But a few of them were spreading it like fire in the community: &ldquo;Watch out, Rahim is living with HIV. Watch out, don&rsquo;t share these things with him, don&rsquo;t do with him. If you have a sexual partner make sure he knows that Rahim is living with HIV.&rdquo; So that was like a bad thing, a negative thing. </p>
<p>Another part of that is me going to national television as well and my neighbourhood finding out that I&rsquo;m living with HIV and I heard stories that they were trying to make me suffer when I come home. They said they were going to wait for him. And of course the attitude changed towards me in the neighbourhood. Which was like: &lsquo;Okay I didn&rsquo;t have a relationship with you to begin with, why should I bother myself with you all?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s just like the looks and all that and, of course, the hairdresser as well stopped receiving me. I think one of the reasons that I have long hair is just because of that memory. Even though I am over it. Actually, I like my hair long. I digress, I digressed. But, yeah, it was like I went, it was my regular barbershop, and I went there for my haircut and he said:&rdquo;I am sorry, we are full.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s when I realised: &lsquo;Oh, okay.&rsquo; And, of course, another Aunt, as well, when I decided to go to national television she was like: &ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo; Before that she was like: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, we support you, living with HIV is like having diabetes or what-not.&rdquo; Then we decided to go out about it and she was like: &ldquo;No. You should not do that, you&rsquo;re going to make&hellip; You&rsquo;re going to bring dishonour on this family, you&rsquo;re gonna bring shame, not dishonour. You&rsquo;re gonna bring shame to this family. We&rsquo;re going to disown you if you did that.&rdquo; I was like: &ldquo;Go ahead, girl. Because if I don&rsquo;t go to national television I would not be able to talk to you anymore.&rdquo; And if&hellip; And she said: &ldquo;Well, your loss.&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;Well, either way I&rsquo;m going to lose you so I may as well do it!&rdquo; And she was like: &ldquo;Well, if you did it, you&rsquo;re gonna lose a whole family. But we&rsquo;re going to lose only one person.&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine with that. I&rsquo;m really fine with that. And luckily I just lost her, I didn&rsquo;t lost the part, the other members of the family. And also, like, again, I don&rsquo;t try to focus on that negativity because I think that if I did focus on it, I would not be reaching what I reached, everything that I reached today. And like, and even though I lost some relationship, the most important relationship that I gained is with myself. Is trusting myself and trusting my guts and knowing my worth and knowing who I am and not letting just a virus control me. That was the most important thing that I was going with and everyone who was asking me about my diagnosis I would just look them in the eye and say: &ldquo;Yes, I am and do you have any questions?&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s how&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I got this community against, because of my serology. &lsquo;Cause I think I showed strength and resilience. </p>
<p>Like I said, there are some who&rsquo;ve been there for me like since forever and there are people who like: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to associate myself with him because if I am his friend people will think I am also living with HIV.&rdquo; You know? So, of course. Especially in the community, the gay community and the gay community in Morocco is very small. Everyone knows everyone. Even if you are the newest member of the LGBTQ community everyone will know about you, you know? And being associated with someone who is living with HIV is like&hellip; the plague. You know, literally. Like, everyone thinks that you have HIV as well. And funny enough - which is like a positive thing to have &ndash; obviously I&rsquo;m not going to mention it, it&rsquo;s okay. </p>
<p>So, like I said, coming to the UK was very daunting to me because I didn&rsquo;t know nobody here. I didn&rsquo;t know even Wales. I thought I was going to go and London was going to be my home! You know? But then the Home Office is like, whatever the Home Office wants you to be, you&rsquo;re gonna be there. And then I came to Cardiff and then I started building this community through an organisation called&hellip; No, it&rsquo;s not an organisation, it&rsquo;s a social group, it&rsquo;s called Glitter Cymru, for LGBT black, Asian and minority ethnics here in Cardiff and south Wales. And I went to the first meeting and I was like feeled so weird about it because there was a lot of people who looked like me there and I didn&rsquo;t have&hellip; Beforehand, a lot of people would say: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an asylum seeker,&rdquo; and I would have to explain what it is being an asylum seeker and di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di- and all that, but with them it was like: &ldquo;Oh! You&rsquo;ve been through the same thing? So, I understand what you mean.&rdquo; You know? And even like&hellip; And the importance of that group and that community &ndash; because I cultivated best friends now like who are brothers and sisters to me now they come home whenever they want and I go to theirs whenever I want and when I feel bad or happy the first thing I do is share the news with them and through the four years that I&rsquo;ve been an asylum seeker, I&rsquo;ve been through hell, literally, from being rejected, from being homeless, from, from, from being refused entry to venues here because of the strange ID that I had. I&rsquo;ve been through it all. But with them, and it made it easier with me, to, to&hellip; So that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s... Having that is very important and having a shoulder to cry on I think is the real meaning of the community and for me being supportive. You know that friend who you did something really worse than, that you can think of? &ldquo;I support you!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s my community... And if you feel so ridiculous and you did like a strange dance. Or you went to ask someone else and that person rejected you, you have someone to hold your hand while crying. So, yeah. And no judgements, you know, like as well. When I came to here I didn&rsquo;t have to only come out as a gay man, but also a person living with HIV. And I think I was na&iuml;ve at first to think there that is no stigma here in the UK and there is no discrimination here in the UK. And of course I was hurt. One of my partners, like, one of my exes broke off with me because of this reason, me being na&iuml;ve that &lsquo;oh, HIV is not a problem in the UK.&rsquo; We are not in Morocco or a developing country. We are in a developed country. And I was wrong, of course, there is a lot of stigma, there is a lot of things&hellip; But with the community that I have and my friends and they of course they ask questions because they were not aware of what it means to be living with HIV. But there was not a stigma. It was just: &ldquo;I want to understand it more, I want to understand it for me to support you more and understand you more.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s how we should be, you know? Not being afraid of asking questions. And to be living together and I think that&rsquo;s the essence of a community. </p>
<p>I think in Wales, in general, having a safe space is really tricky. God. It&rsquo;s really tricky, especially for an ethnic-minority person it&rsquo;s really tricky because the community here in Cardiff &ndash; I&rsquo;m not trying to slander anyone, but this is the reality &ndash; it&rsquo;s so white. It&rsquo;s merely catered for white people. For, and merely catered for the white CIS men, you know what I mean? Even when I was&hellip; Even when I moved here that was very noticeable: that the music is for white people, the drinks is for white people, the decoration, the decoration of the venues are for white people and also, like, for asylum seekers and the refugees the drop-in centres and the what-not, they merely caters to the straight man. You know, they are not catered for the women, they&rsquo;re not &ndash; at all! There&rsquo;s no safe spaces for the LGBT community here. And, and the only safe space going back to Glitter was that. It was Glitter every month for two hours, which was like, and then you&rsquo;re going to go back home doing nothing as an asylum seeker, where you&rsquo;re not allowed to work, you&rsquo;re not allowed to do anything. You&rsquo;re not allowed to volunteer but the organisation that you&rsquo;re allowed to volunteer with are not safe for a queer person and it took, I think&hellip; And we are working on creating safe spaces here in Wales not only for the LGBT community who are white but also mostly for the ethnic-minority, but for me as someone who really suffered homophobia from the first-hand with the housing system provided by the Home Office and the feeling, feeling like: &ldquo;Oh my god, I left that community!&rdquo; and I run away from hate and crime and being not myself to be put in the same house with that, with that hostility. And we are trying to create a momentum of&hellip; with the Home Office and Clearspring who are house, who are housing providers, to create a safe space for actually the next generation of asylum seekers who want to be here. But to answer about the safe housing here, safe spaces here, I think every individual creates its own safe space. You know? And my safe space was my room. Now I do have a lovely support in my new house, but I&rsquo;m getting used to it. It&rsquo;s not something that I&hellip; It&rsquo;s since like since February, so it&rsquo;s like trying to feel that I actually am safe in this room and I&rsquo;m safe in this house and getting over the pitying state that was built up and created over for years and&hellip; </p>
<p>If I had to describe myself&hellip; If I would have to describe myself I would start with first of all loud. Talented, for sure. Kind. Imperfect. I cry a lot, emotional. And&hellip; Energetic in the right time and the right moment. And&hellip; enthusiastic as well, and hopeful for the future. And want something&hellip; I want something&hellip; unity. And I want clarity and I want transparence, something that we don&rsquo;t have unfortunately in the UK the way I imagined, so&hellip; Yeah, that&rsquo;s how I will describe myself. And of course totally gorgeous and beautiful. And, of course, yeah. Don&rsquo;t touch my hair! </p>
<p>I would like to add to this interview, I think, we always I think for me, what I would like&hellip; Okay, I&rsquo;m going to repeat. What I would like to add to this interview or to this piece is that sometimes we focus on the perspective of the others towards people living with HIV and sometimes we forget people living with HIV themselves this series or this piece of art will hopefully inspire another person living with HIV who had bad feelings about themselves of self-hate, regret, shame, self-blame and all that. That: it&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s no-one that wants to put themselves in this position but it happens and life moves on and life&rsquo;s still beautiful and people will perceive us the way that we perceive ourselves so think of that. I think it&rsquo;s very important to not self-stigmatise otherwise we&rsquo;re gonna be stigmatised again. That&rsquo;s it. </p>
