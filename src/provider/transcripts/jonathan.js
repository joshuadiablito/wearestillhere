Hello. My name is Jonathan Blake. Just choking on a nut. On a piece of homemade boiled fruit cake, with almonds on the top. There. Yes, so my name is Jonathan Blake. I was born in July 1949. I&rsquo;m now 71-plus. I was diagnosed with HIV in October 1982, actually it was called HTLV-3. Human-lymph-something-adenopathy-something-virus-3. I don&rsquo;t know what the&hellip; I don&rsquo;t really know what it was. I could look it up, but I haven&rsquo;t&hellip; But then it became known as HIV in, I think it was about 1987. Originally, it was HTLV-3 in this country and in the United States and it was LAV in France. But I think it was Luc Montaigner who actually finally kind of discovered the virus. I think I&rsquo;m correct in this and so they decided that they wanted to rename it so that it was simpler. And so they eventually called it HIV which is human immunodeficiency virus and I&rsquo;ve been living with that for almost thirty-eight years &lsquo;cause October 82 to well, here we are, December 2020. I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones. Yeah.
</p>
<p>
Oh, home. I mean&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s the place where one feels safe. So it&rsquo;s a safe place. And it&rsquo;s where one can just be one&rsquo;s self, let your guard down, feel sad if you&rsquo;re sad, weep, just be who you are. And for me it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s something that is really really special. And I suppose that some of that is because having chosen to be an actor, which is kind of what I wanted to be, I suppose I wanted to live in make-believe and I was very fortunate in that I was one of three boys.
</p>
<p>
My mother, who was born in Swansea, south Wales, the second daughter of the rabbi who lived there. She was born in January 1914 but in the March of that year they emigrated to Canada and they went to live in Winnipeg in a house that was built on stilts because of the snow. And they kept chickens because you need eggs so the chickens, but also in order to feed themselves every so often a hen would be taken for the pot and being that it was a kosher household they just used to chop the heads and so the chickens would run around with their wings flapping and my Mother could never stand flapping birds and I remember as a child being given by a great aunt, well, an aunt who was married to a great uncle so that made her a great aunt even though she much younger than him, Ray, but she liked parrakeets and budgerigars and she gave me a budgerigar and every so often I would let the budgerigar out because I knew that would freak my mother out. God, I was an awful child. Oh dear. And then of course it would be my mother who would have to catch it to put it back in. Which she did, so, that&rsquo;s fine. But yes, so&hellip; I was born in Birmingham which is where my father&rsquo;s family were from. My mother&rsquo;s, basically, my maternal grandfather &ndash; who I said was a rabbi, he was orthodox &ndash; they moved to Winnipeg and then for some reason and I don&rsquo;t know what the reason is and I would always love to know, he turned Reform in 1924 and they moved from Winnipeg to Montreal. And to a Reform synagogue there, and my mother always remembers how the joy of a) skiing down Mont Real in the snow but also suddenly they tasted bacon because they were no longer from, they weren&rsquo;t orthodox, so there was all this tres-funky meats that they could have. And that was great because also she loved shellfish and so we were introduced to shellfish at a very early age.
</p>
<p>
And we were very fortunate in terms that my father had a house furnishing business in Birmingham so I suppose we were just a middle-class family but what was fascinating was that his family and sort of extended family would go to the orthodox synagogue because they originally were orthodox and one day, one Friday night, the rabbi berated people &ldquo;&hellip; who they know who they are in the congregation...&rdquo; who not only break the Sabbath by opening on a Saturday, they sell unclean meats because they had a grocery business and they felt they should cater for the population so they sold bacon, they sold ham, because that&rsquo;s what the people who shopped there wanted. So, there were ten cousins, brothers and cousins and being as it was orthodox the men sat downstairs, the women sat upstairs. They got up as a body, they looked up at the women and children up in the gallery and they walked out and formed the Reform synagogue, the liberal synagogue in Birmingham. And I remember that there were even times when people in Birmingham who if they saw my parents coming down the street they would cross over. I mean, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; religion is&hellip; Just&hellip; What a mess. So yes, so anyway, my mother was born in Swansea but emigrated, but then her father died so in 1926 - so they&rsquo;d moved to Montreal &ndash; in 1926, he was 44, he had a massive heart attack and died. And they were basically left penniless. They had to sell everything that they had bar a few books. There was my maternal grandmother and my aunt, my mother&rsquo;s elder sister and Annie was probably about twenty or even thirty years older than my mother. She was to become a journalist. So they had to sell up everything and move back to this country where my maternal grandmother&rsquo;s aunt had married a man called Louis Silkin and they lived in Dulwich, so they moved to Dulwich. Annie was alright &lsquo;cause she had a job, she was a journalist, so she used to go out to work but my mother, even though this man Louis Silkin had three sons who didn&rsquo;t lift a finger, they had servants, manservants, maid-servants, what-have-you; my mother was made to skivvy, to earn her keep but what was fascinating was that when I moved to where I live now which is in this lesbian/gay community of Brixton Housing Co-Op and there are five houses on Railton Road and there are three houses on the road behind, which is Mayall Rd which has this wonderful communal garden and when I moved here I thought: &lsquo;Oh god, how am I going to tell my parents that I live in Brixton, Burnhill Brixton?&rsquo; because all they&rsquo;ll think of is riots, but this is where I&rsquo;m living, they&rsquo;re going to come and visit so I need to tell them, so I remember saying &ldquo;...oh, this is where I live,&rdquo; and my mother went: &ldquo;Oh, I used to walk down Railton Road everyday.&rdquo; From 1926 she would walk down Railton Road actually walk all the way from Dulwich where she would walk down Railton Road to get to the bus stop outside Morley&rsquo;s, which is a big department store there, because she was at school at Elephant and Castle so she would take the bus to Elephant and Castle. So she remembered Railton Road when it was kind of posh and middle-class. It was never a problem in her head, you know. I&rsquo;d come home. Which is amazing. I just love that idea that there are all these connections, so many in my life, it always seems that there are just so many connections. But I ramble on.
</p>
<p>
Well I would say [my home] that it&rsquo;s probably cluttered but everything that I have in it holds a memory so there is nothing, I don&rsquo;t think there is anything, that I have in it and&hellip; That doesn&rsquo;t mean something but personal to me. How would I describe it? Well, it has basically a living room and a kitchen that sort of are connected. I love cooking so there are lots of cooking pots around and bakeware. Lots of objet, potted plants, there&rsquo;s a sofa bed and a sofa. It&rsquo;s really difficult to&hellip; It&rsquo;s lived in. It&rsquo;s really&hellip; It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s lived in. And I have. I&rsquo;ve lived in the place where I am now, I&rsquo;ve been here for almost thirty-five years, because October in 1985 we moved in to this current house. So yeah, I&rsquo;ve been here thirty-five years and it kind of tells because there is just all this &ndash; probably people would say detritus &ndash; but it isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s all&hellip; I have a work table which is up against the wall and comes down because I retrained as a tailor so I was able to use that as a cutting table. I used to have a big leather sewing machine but basically after I had to sort of&hellip; My health gave out, when I was a... I&rsquo;d retrained. I&rsquo;d been an actor in my former self, pre the virus, meeting the virus. Then the business seemed to have given me up, so that was that, and I retrained as a tailor. Eventually. I went to a &ndash; it&rsquo;s an amazing story &ndash; Nigel, my partner, who I&rsquo;ve known and lived with now for thirty-seven years, he and a friend of his were going to do a trouser-making class and I said: &ldquo;Oh, that sounds fun, can I come along?&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, the more the merrier,&rdquo; and we paid our pound to go and do it. We arrived at this adult education centre nearby, nearby, near to Brixton where we lived, called the Strand Centre and we were up on the fifth floor in what had been the old chemistry laboratories so these tall tables and there was this lovely elderly Jewish tailor called Harry and the first thing that Harry said was: &ldquo;I want you to sit cross-legged on the table,&rdquo; &lsquo;cause that&rsquo;s how tailors used to sit. My father used to sell furniture. If you ever sat on a table you were screamed at &ldquo;&hellip; get off the table, chairs are for sitting on not tables!&rdquo; So Harry, with one phrase, had given me permission. I was up there sitting cross-legged, you know. Originally, you would have a board across your legs and that is what you sewed on. And the reason for that was you paid for your table-space. And that was like the cheapest way that you could so you&rsquo;d have a whole number of tailors all sitting on a big table. Chatting together. Anyway, so I thought &lsquo;&hellip; this is great, but how many pairs of trousers do I need?&rsquo; Really what I need to do is learn how to make a pattern. So one of the other people say: &ldquo;Oh! They do a pattern-making class at the London College of Fashion.&rdquo; Well, I thought: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve paid my pound, I can do any number of courses. So I headed down to the London College of Fashion, this was at Shoreditch, this is where the tailoring section was, which was the old garment area of the City of London. And I enrolled for this pattern-making class and I loved it, I really thought this was great. And while I was there one of the tutors said: &ldquo;Oh, by the way, I don&rsquo;t know if you might be interested, but we do this three-year diploma in tailoring, City &amp; Guilds.&rdquo; I thought I&rsquo;m going to be dead before I finish that but yeah, it&rsquo;ll keep me busy. You see, I&rsquo;d been a member of Lesbian &amp; Gay Men&rsquo;s Support the Miners and involved with the miner&rsquo;s strike in 1984-85, which was amazing &lsquo;cause for me, once I&rsquo;d got my diagnosis, to me the most important thing was as long as I could keep busy I didn&rsquo;t have to think about the virus or I could, you know, I could have displacement activity. That&rsquo;s what my survival technique is going to be all about. Displacement activities so I&rsquo;m not having to deal with the issue of, you know, this virus. It&rsquo;s enough, I will have to deal with it, but, anyway&hellip; So lots of displacement activity and this was a brilliant displacement activity. Anyway, I enrolled, I managed to persuade Lambeth Council to give me a grant - it then was still grants, we hadn&rsquo;t got to the dreadful situation of today of loans &ndash; so I got a grant and I was able to do some work, there was a local restaurant we used to all work in, Bon Ton Roulet, which was fabulous and Sally Sherritt who owned it was brilliant so that kept us, you know, fed and watered and what have you. So I did and, you know, my parents were thrilled because suddenly I&rsquo;ve got a proper job, you know? It wasn&rsquo;t about, sort of&hellip; Not, not that I was necessarily sort of, you know&hellip; How was I going to get a job as a tailor? &lsquo;Cause, god, I knew I couldn&rsquo;t work down Saville Row, I&rsquo;d kneecap &lsquo;em rather than make clothes for them, but you know, there we go.
</p>
<p>
But actually, eventually, I did get a job, and I got a job making costumes for English National Opera and that was fantastic, &lsquo;cause like, sort of, theatre held no mystique for me because I&rsquo;d been an actor but opera: I loved it. It was so overblown, you know, but the music&hellip; So that was just, that was wonderful. And I started off there as freelance, full-time freelance, wanting a, wanting to be full-time there, you know, paid member of staff because I knew that holiday pay yes would have been important, but sick pay: I knew I was going to need that. You know, at some point my health was going to give out. But actually, you know, amazingly, I managed to get through&hellip; I started working there in 1988 and eventually my health gave out in 1996. So, I was incredibly fortunate.
</p>
<p>
My experience in the theatre stuck with me, in more ways than one. I enrolled in drama college straight after leaving boarding school. My first acting job was in 1970, and for the next decade, I bounced seamlessly from role to role. Chauffeured in a private car, of course. It was semi-fantasy. If ever I had a break from the stage, I would travel. I bought a return ticket to New York, for eighty pounds, and flew. NYC in the &lsquo;70s certainly live up to its colourful reputation. I went to the first night of Grease on Broadway, I went to Bernstein&rsquo;s Mass, I saw Bette Midler in her first concert at Carnegie Hall. My head was turned. Totally turned. So I went back. And this time, I managed to wangle a colleague&rsquo;s empty apartment in the Upper West Side&rsquo;s Ansonia Building. The Ansonia was spacious, glamorous, and above all, it was home to the city&rsquo;s infamous Continental Baths, famed for its all-inclusive hedonism, and was reportedly visited by the likes of Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, and Alfred Hitchcock. It was great, really phenomenal.
</p>
<p>
It was after my return, and whilst working at Joe Allen&rsquo;s &ndash; a London restaurant famously staffed by out of work actors &ndash; that I began to notice something was wrong. I got ill. Every single lymph node in my body was enlarged. I couldn't put my arms by my sides and I was basically walking around like a gorilla.
</p>
<p>
I was diagnosed with a virus which caused &lsquo;persistent lymphadenopathy&rsquo; in October 1982 which ater in 1985 was called HTLV-3. I was 33. I wasn't the first person in the UK to be diagnosed, but I was one of the first. The doctors had no idea what they were dealing with. Nobody did. At the time, it was terminal.
</p>
<p>
I mean, I have been amazingly fortunate in terms of what HIV has dealt to me, yeah, &lsquo;cause god I&rsquo;m 71 now. And I&rsquo;m still here. And I didn&rsquo;t start taking the combination therapy until 1996, &lsquo;cause my health had given out in 1996 and at that point... I&rsquo;d been at the Middlesex initially, then the Middlesex closed down, the famous Broderick Hall, all of that disappeared. We were all moved across from James Pringle House at the Middlesex to Mortimer Market, which was part of University College Hospital. I, in 19... I think 80&hellip; it was either &lsquo;86 or &lsquo;87, had been asked to part of the Concorde Trial, and the Concorde Trial was where they were wanting to see what the effects of the use of AZT, this failed chemotherapy drug which actually killed people rather than doing anything for them. But anyway, so, I was asked if I would enrol in the Concorde Trial and I asked them a, to me a very simple question, and that was: &ldquo;I understand you have a cohort and cut the cohort in half. One half gets the pill, AZT, the other half gets the placebo. So, are you going to match people up so that someone who has a similar build or sort of metabolism to me, we will be paired up, one of us will get the pill the other will get the placebo?&rdquo; And they went: &ldquo;Oh no, that&rsquo;s far too complicated.&rdquo; I sort of saw red and I got a bit, sort of, belligerent. I said: &ldquo;Well.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;If you could put a line down the middle of me&rdquo; &ndash; this is ridiculous &ndash; &ldquo;if you could put a line down the middle of me, give one half of me the pill and the other half the placebo and we&rsquo;ll see which side does best, that I think is a trial. But, if you can&rsquo;t be bothered to do that, I can&rsquo;t be bothered to do your trial.&rdquo; And that I believe is the reason I&rsquo;m still here. Because everybody was being given three grams of the stuff. So a gram in the morning, a gram at lunchtime, a gram in the evening. The dose of AZT when it is now used &ndash; and it&rsquo;s being phased out &ndash; is 1.2 milligrams. I mean, three grams&hellip; And basically old chemotherapy drugs what they do is they wipe out your whole immune system, so they wipe out the cancer but they also wipe out all your T-cells, so it leaves you open to opportunistic infection and that&rsquo;s what was happening to people who were taking the AZT. Their immune systems were wiped out. They had nothing. An opportunistic infection may &ndash; mostly it was PCP, pneumocystispneumonia &ndash; would come along, they&rsquo;d drown in their own lungs. Or they would get CNN-retinitus, go blind. I mean, you know, and&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m still angry about it, all these years later. So when I basically, in 1990, 1989, my T-cell count fell to 200 and that was considered to be an AIDS diagnosis, and I freaked. And because I was considered a difficult patient, &lsquo;cause I hadn&rsquo;t joined the Concorde Trial, I never saw the same consultant or registrar twice. It was always different. I was seen, but, you know, all those things that initially had happened when you&rsquo;d had MRI scans and all kind of things, all that stopped. And I&hellip; So I freaked and I didn&rsquo;t know where to go. I was really fortunate in terms that I had a younger brother. I have an elder brother and a younger brother. Now, my elder brother and I didn&rsquo;t speak. I came out to my parents in the late 60s on my 21st birthday. The gay male age of consent was 21 until 1994. I remember visiting the theatre with my mother when I was a child. I was completely bowled over. I turned to my mother and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be an actor,&rdquo; and she looked at me: &ldquo;Well I hope not like John Gielgud&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t know what on earth she was talking about. It was years until I discovered the actor had been arrested for cottaging in 1953. Despite what I thought, they reacted remarkably well. I thought that they would be horrified. When I announced at the age of 21 that I was gay, I was homosexual, my parents accepted it, in fact my mother actually said &ldquo;&hellip; oh, but we knew,&rdquo; to which I replied: &ldquo;Well, why couldn&rsquo;t you have told me then we could have done away with all the subterfuge!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
But my elder brother said: &ldquo;I can just about deal with you but any of your friends I would smash their faces in.&rdquo; So I said: &ldquo;Fine. We won&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo; And that was it. We didn&rsquo;t talk, you know, I would be civil to him when we went to, sort of, family gatherings but we absolutely no, we just didn&rsquo;t. Right up until the point that&hellip; My mother predeceased my father and when my father died then I told him that I was HIV-positive. I saw his face just drop. But I wanted that to happen, I wanted to shock him. Mean. But anyway, so, so, so he had said that but my younger brother he knew, so it wasn&rsquo;t an issue. He had, gone to Oxford, done &ndash; I think they call it Greats, it&rsquo;s Latin, Greek, Nature, History, Philosophy, god knows what &ndash; anyway he left there, finished, got his degree, worked at the Home Office, and suddenly thought: &lsquo;What am I doing here? I always wanted to be a doctor.&rsquo; So he retrained. He went to Birmingham Medical School. Then came up to London and went to the Westminster. The Westminster closed down, became the Chelsea &amp; Westminster. Part of the Chelsea &amp; Westminster was...
</p>
<p>
Basically, he had worked at the Kobler. So I fled to the Kobler, &lsquo;cause that was like the only other place that I knew. So, when I got my HIV-diagnosis I eventually told him, not, not immediately but after I&rsquo;d&hellip; Basically in the December of that year I&rsquo;d attempted suicide but my mother had said: &ldquo;You clear up your own mess.&rdquo; So, that was it. I&rsquo;ve digressed. Anyway, so I went to the Kobler. They wanted to put me on the medication, they were brilliant in terms of sorting out benefits, disability, living allowance all of that, but they wanted to put me on to pills and I was still so angry about the AZT I didn&rsquo;t want to do that. What was amazing was that in 19... I think it would be 1997, I think that I&rsquo;m right. There was the &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Die of Ignorance&rsquo;&hellip; no, maybe it was 1987 actually, 1987. Yeah, &lsquo;87. There was&hellip; the Government produced this, what I considered to be pretty horrendous, the &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Die of Ignorance&rsquo; campaign, but they did it. To me, it was terrible because all it did was instil fear, it didn&rsquo;t give education to people. But&hellip; What they did do &ndash; which was amazing &ndash; they put money into drop-in centres so there was this wonderful place called the London Lighthouse which was created, you know, and on the top floor was a residential unit which basically was a hospice where people would go to die with dignity. And that was really, really special.
</p>
<p>
And there were other drop-in centres, so, there was one locally called the Landmark and we used to go there. So I would go to the Landmark because it was a safe place and... So you could go there and you could get information. They get help with benefit information and housing information, just everything. And it was a place to go to and there would be food, there would always be food there, because one of the things that happened that people were. When they started on the medication developed this lipodystrophy or lipoatrophy where all the fat drains from out of your arms and your legs and you might get the dowager hump or it just disappears or it just goes onto your organs. So, you look like, y&rsquo;know, you&rsquo;ve just come out of Belsen. This dreadful sort of gaunt, gaunt look. And so they would produce food because the idea was if you ate food that would build you up. They hadn&rsquo;t realised that actually the muscle wastage: it&rsquo;s gone. All the fat has gone, y&rsquo;know. You&rsquo;re not going to get it back. That was, you know, one of the many side-effects of the medication. So we&rsquo;d go there to eat and I remember going there and saying: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I need to find a new HIV consultant because they want to put me on the pills and I don&rsquo;t wanna go on the pills and I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; And somebody said &ldquo;&hellip; oh, I&rsquo;ve got this wonderful doctor down at King&rsquo;s College Hospital. King&rsquo;s College Hospital is down the road and around the corner from where I live. I&rsquo;m crossing half of London to get to the Kobler. So, I make an appointment to see this man and&hellip; I won&rsquo;t say his name, but he was just amazing. I went to see him. He listened to my story and he said: &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;You keep getting shingles and herpes, so I&rsquo;m going to put you on acyclavir prophylactically,&rdquo; because that was the pill that was used when you get shingles to stop it and fight it. And he said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if you can tolerate septrin.&rdquo; Now septrin is a really inexpensive antibiotic which if you can tolerate &ndash; and a lot of people couldn&rsquo;t, so that was the sadness &ndash; but if you can tolerate it that would keep PCP, this pneumocysticpneumonia, at bay and that was, sort of you know, one of the major killers of people. So, he put me on that and that&rsquo;s what I sort of basically survived on up until 1996.
</p>
<p>
Well, in 1996 my health gave out. I got shingles internally on the phrenic nerve, hiccup non-stop for ten days. And then after that I had got no energy. I would literally&hellip; I would wake up in the morning, I would peel myself out of bed and I would come and lie on a sofa in my front room. I would then get off the sofa, I would go and lie back down in bed. I mean, I just&hellip; I had got no energy, I was completely lethargic. And&hellip; Eventually my HIV consultant said: &ldquo;You know, Jonathan, you are now going to have to bite the bullet and start on combination therapy.&rdquo; I thought &lsquo;...well, alright.&rsquo; So he worked out a regime which was twice a day. I can&rsquo;t remember how many pills there were. There was DDI, D-40 and I think something called nevirapine, I think was the three that I had. First week, nothing. Second week, nothing. Third week, still nothing and I think: &ldquo;Why am I putting all these pills inside of me, I mean this is just&hellip;&rsquo; I did. I woke up on the morning of the fourth week I had got so much energy it was like Lazarus raised from the dead. It was like Atlas. I could carry the world on my shoulders. I had got so much energy that I got up and I laid a patio outside my French windows. I mean, I&rsquo;ve never done anything like that in my life. There used to be this wonderful grassy mound. I mean, it&rsquo;s incredible. And... I was good for eleven months and then suddenly I had got such pains in my hands, such pains in my feet, so much so that I would... I would go to the supermarket, I would hang off the trolley keeping my feet off the ground thinking that way I wouldn&rsquo;t feel the pain of course. Of course I felt the pain &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;d got peripheral neuropathy&hellip; it was the nerve endings in my feet and my hands. My partner Nigel was going on this amazing trip with a dear friend of his, they were going to fly to Seattle and then drive through the Rockies to Montana and I thought &lsquo;...you&rsquo;ve got to go. A) you&rsquo;ve got to go because I want you out of here. I don&rsquo;t want to be around you, what have you.&rsquo; And I just want to be ill. I feel lousy. So I pretended everything was fine. He left. The moment he left I got on that phone to my HIV consultant and said: &ldquo;I am so&hellip; Feeling so awful with these pills, I&rsquo;ve got such pains.&rdquo; So I went down, I saw him. He said: &ldquo;Right, we&rsquo;ll change your combination.&rdquo; So he then put me on to something which was combivir and something else. And I was so nauseous it was unbelievable, it was just&hellip; Ugh. Anyway&hellip; So, I&rsquo;m feeling awful. Nigel, happily, has gone. I ring up the consultant, I say: &ldquo;This is not working, I can&rsquo;t bear this. I don&rsquo;t know what&hellip;&rdquo; So he said: &ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re obviously worse on the pills than off, take a drug holiday.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Now, I was on something called combivir. Combivir had AZT in it. Now whether this was psychosomatic&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think it was, but it&rsquo;s interesting. Anyway, I then had a fifteen month drug holiday. What was amazing was that this is 1997. In 1997, viral load testing comes in, so they can now test how much virus you&rsquo;ve got. So, every couple of weeks I would go and have my bloods taken and eventually, when I had only got 70 T-cells left, I had got over a million bits of, parts of virus in a millilitre of blood, I mean&hellip; It&rsquo;s just&hellip; You can&rsquo;t imagine that! How on earth can they all be in there? Anyway, he said: &ldquo;You know, now&rsquo;s the time you&rsquo;re going to have to start back.&rdquo; So, then he worked out a regime and basically I&rsquo;ve been on the medication ever since. It&rsquo;s slightly changed, but&hellip; Yeah.
</p>
<p>
I think that because, as I say, having been an actor and you&rsquo;re going out on tour, so for me having somewhere that I could call home, even if it was just a bedsit, somewhere I could be me, that I could entertain, I wasn&rsquo;t having to perform or what-have-you, was really important and I think it&rsquo;s always been important. I think maybe it became even more important, perhaps the very fact you&rsquo;re given a terminal diagnosis, your perception of what is important changes. So, having a roof over one&rsquo;s head was und-. And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m being incredibly lucky. My meeting with Nigel, as I say I got my diagnosis, attempted to commit suicide in December of 1982, couldn&rsquo;t, since I couldn&rsquo;t then nice Jewish boy if you can&rsquo;t kill yourself you&rsquo;ve gotta get on and live. How you&rsquo;re gonna get on and live? So, I used to go out to pubs. I wanted to be with people but I wanted to send out all the vibes not to come near me because I&rsquo;ve got this killer virus coursing through my veins. I&rsquo;m a modern-day leper. You do not want it. So, it was really really difficult.
</p>
<p>
And I remember picking up this newspaper &ndash; Capital Gay &ndash; seeing this tiny advertisement, &lsquo;Gays For A Nuclear Free Future,&rsquo; running a coach from Gay&rsquo;s The Word to go to do this stand together. Went there, met Nigel Young &ndash; I think I&rsquo;ve said all this before &ndash; but anyway, so, the very act of meeting him just changed everything. I mean, that to me was probably the best day of my life and the fact that we&rsquo;re still living together all these years. Well, you&rsquo;ve heard on the tape &lsquo;cause he came down and I had to send him away, but&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I saw a call to action from Gays for a Nuclear Free Future encouraging people to join them on a protest. I decided to go along. That was going to be my re-entry into society. As soon as I got close, saw the coach outsider Gay&rsquo;s The Word, my courage failed me and as I turned to flee this man came up to me. He was wearing green wellington boots, a fair-isle sweater and he had a mop of black hair. His name was Nigel. We spent the whole day together. The next day, Nigel came round to my flat with a bunch of flowers and a box of doughnuts. What more could you want? Almost 40 years later, we still live together.
</p>
<p>
So, home is just really really really&hellip; It&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s special and here I have been incredibly lucky because I live in this gay and lesbian community so there are four houses on one street, five houses on the other, there&rsquo;s a big communal garden. For twelve years, I got to plant this fancy garden. Nobody was interested. Suddenly people got interested. &ldquo;Ooh, can I have a place?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ooh, is this a communal garden? Are we all part and parcel of it?&rdquo; I would come indoors, I would stamp my feet. It was like my best toy had just been taken from me. I was so angry. But no, I mean, it&rsquo;s been amazing and there are now a number of people who are involved in keeping the garden and looking after it and tending it and so it&rsquo;s, yeah, it&rsquo;s, y&rsquo;know...
</p>

Positive reactions are very simple and straightforward because for the most part, I&rsquo;ve never felt kind of ostracised but I never told anyone of my HIV diagnosis when I was working at English National Opera until much later because, you know, one&rsquo;s working with sewing machines. It used to terrify me, the fact that I might get my finger stuck in the machine. What was I going to do? Could there be blood everywhere? How was one going to deal with it? But what was amazing was that when I went for my interview there, I remember, sort of, being told to sort of go and wait in the workroom and everybody is busy working there and I really didn&rsquo;t want to engage in conversation with people, I&rsquo;m feeling nervous and what are you&rsquo;re going to say? So I&rsquo;m looking at, around the walls and my eye hits on a letter on the notice board and it was from St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, Paddington thanking everyone in the workroom for all their support to Peter, Peter who was the head cutter there who had just died from HIV/AIDS. And I thought: &lsquo;I want to work here because when I get ill, they&rsquo;ll understand. I&rsquo;m not going to tell them, it&rsquo;ll all be by osmosis, but, you know.&rsquo; It was so that&hellip; I felt I was at least going into a safe space even though I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily going to share it with them.
</p>
<p>
So, that&rsquo;s a really positive thing. Really the only negative one, is really, you know&hellip; When you go on to &ndash; and I have gone on to &ndash; these sites like Grinder and the shite that you get &lsquo;cause I like to be upfront about my HIV diagnosis &lsquo;cause I kinda feel that people have gotta make an informed choice and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to have to sort of get to that situation where I&rsquo;m going to meet someone and then one has got to tell them. I think they need to know so they can go, you know, &ldquo;&hellip; er, no; not for me.&rdquo; Well, you didn&rsquo;t just get &lsquo;no, not for me,&rsquo; you used to get just the most unbelievable hate and shite and of course, sort of, you know, they didn&rsquo;t understand and then I would send huge messages explaining to them the realities of living with HIV and what it meant and, you know, whether one was safe and blah blah blah. I mean, it probably washed over them. So, that is, to be honest, I think that those are the only areas where I&rsquo;ve ever kind of felt, you know, a really negative impact but at the same time I&rsquo;ve been really fortunate in that all the people that I know, know. I went to drama school and there are a few people from drama school that I still see, they all&hellip; you know, I told them. So I&rsquo;ve always told, I&rsquo;ve been very open about my diagnosis, &lsquo;cause I just think it&rsquo;s important. I think it&rsquo;s important to be upfront and I&rsquo;ve been in a really, I suppose, privileged situation of being, you know, in safe environments, so when I finished working at English National Opera in the wardrobe there, had to finish, I used to go and volunteer at the Landmark, which was this wonderful drop-in centre. So&hellip; And I used to work on reception there, &lsquo;cause I kind of felt like you&rsquo;re there, you&rsquo;re the frontline, people are coming in in crisis, you know, hopefully I can make them at least feel comfortable and they&rsquo;re alright, so&hellip; I did. And I enjoyed it. There reached a point that Nigel, my partner, in&hellip; 2013, yeah, had a stroke. And at that point, the Landmark had been taken over by Terrence Higgins Trust so I had left there, &lsquo;cause there were too many changes. But then, Nigel needed to get support &lsquo;cause he got diagnosed in &lsquo;96 and he had Karposi&rsquo;s sarcoma, so, I remember him taking off his t-shirt and me seeing the Karposi&rsquo;s mark on his back and thinking: &lsquo;What am I going to do? How am I going to tell you?&rsquo; But we got through it and, you know, what was amazing was the fact that the medication was already there so he was seen and it cleared, you know. So&hellip; sort of&hellip; God, that&rsquo;s also, perhaps that&rsquo;s also one of those not-so-good moments, but it wasn&rsquo;t, you know, he and I, sort of, sexually we hadn&rsquo;t been compatible so I knew that it wasn&rsquo;t, that I hadn&rsquo;t passed it to him. So&hellip; Yeah, that was&hellip; But anyway, so, the Landmark had closed down. It had been taken over by Terrence Higgins Trust. They had opened a place in Waterloo called Lighthouse South London, because they&rsquo;d also taken over the Lighthouse, rescued it. And so I went down with Nigel to, for his appointment, and the woman on reception was, had been the manager at the Landmark and Jeanie said: &ldquo;Oh, hello! You wouldn&rsquo;t like to volunteer here would you?&rdquo; And I thought: &lsquo;Yeah, why not?&rsquo; So I started volunteering there and was there for about, I don&rsquo;t know, about ten years or so. Until Nigel had his stroke and I thought: &lsquo;No, I&hellip; This is where my priority is so I need to sort of... do that.&rsquo; But I still do the odd, sort of, I&rsquo;m part of something called Positive Voices. So, we go and talk in schools about living with HIV and try to educate, you know, kids or youth clubs or&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been doing them on the Zooms and what-have-you. We did one with someone for the Ralph Lauren organisation, which, basically was being recorded there. At one point there were, I think , 87 people on the Zoom but they were recording it and going to be playing it to the whole organisation so, you know, hundreds of people would have seen it. So, yeah&hellip; It&rsquo;s one&rsquo;s way of giving back, you know, for all the support I&rsquo;ve had from my community I suppose.
</p>
<p>
I suppose so in terms that, you know, I would go to gay bars and you know&hellip; I think I excluded myself. I&rsquo;m not so sure that I would necessarily&hellip; You know, it&rsquo;s a difficult one. There is always this thing that, you know, would they have excluded you? Or did you exclude yourself so they didn&rsquo;t need to? You know&hellip; It&rsquo;s a difficult.. But, I mean, yes, there were times it was difficult. But what was interesting was that when I was a member of Lesbian &amp; Gay Men&rsquo;s Support the Miners and we went and supported the miners in south Wales, because again, for me south Wales was really important not only because like, kind of, going there and because of my mother but also my first television that I did was something called The Regiment and we&rsquo;d done all the studio scenes and they were then going to do the external scenes and I&rsquo;d got a pantomime and it was in Swansea, the Swansea Grand. And so, they decided the external scenes they wanted to shoot was for the Veldt and they used the heath above Neath, sorry it&rsquo;s a rhyme, but yeah, so the heathland above Neath. So a car would come and collect me from my digs in Swansea, take me to do the filming and then bring me back to the stage door of the Grand. I mean, it was amazing. And what was extraordinary was that it was during the first miner&rsquo;s strike and there was the three-day week where you would get electricity for three days and four days off and so the theatre bought a ship&rsquo;s fog light and a generator so the show could go on so there were four days where you had this blinding white light. For Anna-Lou and Maria to do their dog and pigeon act. It was amazing, it was fab. Loved it! But yeah, so south Wales. I was connected with south Wales with my mother, with the pantomime, and the filming and then down in south Wales, and everybody there knew, so I was out about my HIV status. So for them it was an education, of course. And people were just so generous it was amazing, given the hardship they were going to they couldn&rsquo;t have been more kinder or generous in what they offered to us. Amazing experience, absolutely amazing.
</p>
<p>
I mean, I was always out about it because I was able to be out about it and I was in a safe space and I was in a safe community, I lived in a lesbian and gay community, so, people knew, we were all being affected by it. So in those terms, you know, a lot of those places, you know, that were important to me, weren&rsquo;t affected. But I remember that, you see my younger brother knew, so I knew my parents never did know &lsquo;cause I decided I wasn&rsquo;t going to tell them, you know, they&rsquo;d had enough dealing with my coming out, you know, when I was 21, why should I put them through this? My younger brother knew and I knew that when I got ill he would be able to explain the realities of it. Not all the misinformation that the right-wing press was pumping out. So he knew, so that was good. But, my elder brother never knew up until when my father died and then I said &lsquo;right&rsquo;... But what was extraordinary is that it did shock him and it winded him and he then used to ring up to check that I was alright, which was amazing. What was even more amazing was that when Pride came out, he rang me up and he said: &ldquo;Oh, our local rural cinema is going to be, have chosen Pride and they&rsquo;re going to show it in our village hall.&rdquo; They don&rsquo;t know that I know you, will you come down for it? And I just thought: &lsquo;That is amazing.&rsquo; And I said: &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; And I also wanted to see where he lived. And I remember going down there and he&rsquo;d arranged to have me put up in the most wonderful BnB that was run by friends of his. And I thought: &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a shame. You couldn&rsquo;t put me up where you live.&rsquo; Well, the next day he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you to where I live.&rdquo; Well, he took me to where he lives. He lives in a little sort of flat on a farm. It was such a tip. I mean, there was filthy washing in the sink that had gone on, obviously for days&hellip; I mean, it was just disgusting. I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t have stayed there if he&rsquo;d have paid me. Oh, it was just&hellip; I felt really sad for him. And he was someone that&hellip; I mean, he always felt that, like, as the eldest son he was responsible. He and I had had a really difficult relationship because he&rsquo;s three years older than me and then I come along and take all the love that he feels should have been for him. But he&rsquo;s very kind of conventional and conservative with a small C and what-have-you. And, he had been in love with some young woman and my parents didn&rsquo;t approve and put the kibosh on him, so that all fell through. Then he married someone who was already, had been married and already had a family and there were two young girls or young women even at that point, who, really &lsquo;cause he is a chauvinist and was a chauvinist, so&hellip; They had no truck for him, but she also had a young son. He and my elder brother were absolutely&hellip; Just got on. And then Jamie was killed in a car crash. And that absolutely devastated Dick. Absolutely devastated him. So, for him to have made that move to invite me there was just amazing. And, you know, we kind of, you know&hellip; So, we do, we speak every sort of couple of weeks or so. I see him from time-to-time. He&rsquo;ll go down, or used to go down and have Christmas with my younger brother, who lives down in Devon. He become an oncologist, but dealing in radiography, so zapping the cancer, not as a surgeon. So yeah&hellip; As a family we&rsquo;re still sort of, I suppose, relatively close. I know Nigel&rsquo;s family, sort of, there, and we&rsquo;re sort of close. Yeah, so sort of&hellip; I can&rsquo;t think that, it&rsquo;s not really that&hellip; Well, I choose who I tell and I tell most people. So, I&rsquo;m comfortable. Well, I should be after all these years. But I&rsquo;m amazed. I never thought I would see forty. I mean, I hit 40 - I was diagnosed when I was 33 - had a wonderful party here, when I was 40 and I was working at the ENO. It was great. And a lot of people that I worked with came. And then 50 and then 60 and then I had an amazing 70th in the garden. It&rsquo;s a brilliant space for parties. I&rsquo;ve been incredibly lucky. Incredibly lucky. Absolutely blessed. And I don&rsquo;t know why, I mean you know&hellip; But, yeah&hellip; Who would have thought it?
</p>
<p>
Part of the safe space and the fact that there is this, you know, this communal garden, you know, which I just love, &lsquo;cause for me, you know, when you&rsquo;re given a terminal diagnosis the fact of having a garden&hellip; There is always something happening, whether there are plants that are dying back or, you know, there are buds for next year or, you know, there is always something happening, in that, so it&rsquo;s&hellip; It&rsquo;s very special and it&rsquo;s really sort of fed me. You know? And it repays. And what is lovely is that, you know, people enjoy it so it&rsquo;s something to very easily sort of share. Yeah&hellip; So, I love going out and sweeping up the weeds, the leaves. That I didn&rsquo;t do when you came, I should have. I suddenly realised I should have. Anyway, but I didn&rsquo;t, I hadn&rsquo;t totally manicured it. It&rsquo;s really really special and, you know, as kids we were really lucky in terms that we had, or my parents had a gardener, Gardener Hill, and he used to breed auriculas. He named a few after my mother. Which is sort of extraordinary. He would take us to the, sort of, the Natural History Museum. Which was wonderful, you know, it was like kind of&hellip; I&rsquo;ve always had this love of nature and we were fortunate we lived in Birmingham &ndash; I was born in Birmingham &ndash; but my parents, you know, we used to go to north Wales, &lsquo;cause north Wales is the nearest coast to Birmingham. And we would go and take over a boarding house. And then, you know, friends, relations would come and stay and then my parents decided this was silly, you know, it was so expensive but why didn&rsquo;t they buy? There was a relatively expensive house comparatively. So they bought a house there, so we used to go down and spend our, sort of, you know, Easters there and Whit there and summers there and, you know, my father would go back to Birmingham to work but we would stay which used to drive my mother mad, so every so often she&rsquo;d get really angry and put pudding basins on my hair and give us a haircut as punishment. Good old Golda. But yeah, no no, it was really, it was ideal. And my father loved trains, he had a train set, which sort of used to come down off the wall a bit like my tailoring table, come down off the wall and there was a central hole where he could be, you know, directing the traffic and he&rsquo;d have all these trains going around. I mean, what was interesting was it was just track. He never bothered to, you know, some people, you know, create landscapes and what so&hellip; No, no. For him it was about track, it was about the actual engines and the trains and I remember sort of, you know, when we moved from the house in Birmingham and they eventually sort of moved to, out to, to a place called Knowle, then Lapworth and he had a little, a Z-gauge, which is a tiny train set, that literally was on a board that could sit on a table and then be put to one side if the deck was needed. So, he always, you know, his train set was really important to him.
</p>
<p>
How it [the group that supported the miners] came about? Basically. There was two people. Mark Ashton and Mike Jackson and both of them worked at switchboards, so they were sort of connected and they decided that - they were highly political, you know. Mark was a young communist, Mike was always sort of, you know, a member of the Labour Party, trade unionist to the core, both of them &ndash; and they decided that when Thatcher was attacking the miners that they needed, you know, the miners needed support and it was then a question of how were we going to, where were we going to put our support? Because we needed to find sort of colliery or collieries where maybe there were connections. Well, it just so happened that in south Wales, the south Wales miners had already had connections with the young communists so there was already this kind of connection between communists and the South Wales coal fuel, so when it came to organising that where would we go to offer support that would be the obvious place because there was already a connection so what happened was that Mike Jackson sent a letter&hellip; Now in the film - there&rsquo;s a film called Pride - it&rsquo;s a phonecall. It wasn&rsquo;t a phonecall, it was a letter that was sent and what was interesting was that Sian James told us, probably about sort of ten years ago, what actually happened. So, the letter was received by the community and they sort of received it and they were reading it out and there were all the batty-boy jokes and all of that and all of a sudden they kind of stopped and thought: &lsquo;What are we doing?&rsquo; Now, this is a group that is highly political anyway in terms of, you know, their politics. In 1923 when the mines were privately owned, there was a strike and the mine owners brought in Galician miners to break the strike. When the Galician miners arrived there and realised they had been brought in to break a strike, they joined the strike. And there is a row of cottages called the Spanish Cottages named &rsquo;cause that&rsquo;s where they lived. So, they have this politics. When Mao Tse-Tung finished the Long March they sent a telegram to congratulate him on completing it, completing it. I mean, so, you know, they&rsquo;re absolutely rooted in politics. So, they stopped and thought: &lsquo;What are we doing with all these sort of jokes? No, we will accept their money.&rsquo; And they said to everyone: &ldquo;If you have a problem with the gays , as we were called, the gays coming down, you will know when they&rsquo;re coming and you just make yourself scarce. And basically, we had no idea &lsquo;cause we were just welcomed so warm-heartedly, you know, so like I say it wasn&rsquo;t until recent past, you know, once the film was out that one heard what had actually happened whereas in the film it&rsquo;s a telephone call and, you know, they get to meet.
</p>
<p>
How could I describe myself other than&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think about, sort of, I just like&hellip; Just a regular bloke. No I&rsquo;m not. I mean, you know, I&rsquo;m opinionated but I&rsquo;m very loyal. I am loyal. So, like you know, I have, I have no friendships from when I was at school, but I still have friendships from when I was at drama school, so from 1967. They&rsquo;re&hellip; and I am. I am very loyal, but I am my mother&rsquo;s son and she was&hellip; She could be hard. And I can be hard, you know? Demanding. You know, opinionated. But at root I&rsquo;m sort of alright, I just think, you know&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. How on earth can one sort of describe yourself, you know? I can&rsquo;t say 6-foot-3 eyes are blue &lsquo;cause I don&rsquo;t going to have that I ain&rsquo;t 6-foot-3 but&hellip; You know. I&rsquo;m warm. I&rsquo;m sort of generous but if I take against you god-help-you &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m not nice, you know. Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Who knows?
</p>
<p>
You should try my lemon drizzle cake&hellip; I mean, that was what was amazing was that I remember, sort of, Stephen Beresford ringing me up and saying: &ldquo;Oh, hello Jonathan, the director and the actor who&rsquo;s going to play you would like to meet you, is that possible?&rdquo; So I said: &ldquo;Yeah, when were you thinking?&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;How about tomorrow tea-time?&rdquo; Oh god, there&rsquo;s just enough time to make a lemon drizzle cake&hellip; &ldquo;Yes! Yep, that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Because you can&rsquo;t have people to tea without cake. And I remember, sort of, he arrived, and he&rsquo;d got this amazing bouquet. &ldquo;Oh, are you going to a wedding?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re for you.&rdquo; Thrusting this bouquet of cabbages and cabbage roses. I mean, just exquisite. So I said: &ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re at a costume fitting they&rsquo;ll be along.&rdquo; &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You can come in, you can have tea but no cake &lsquo;til they arrive. So, we&rsquo;re chatting away and then the doorbell goes, so I go to the door and this man thrusts out his hand and introduces himself as Matthew Warchus, the director, and over his shoulder I can see McNulty from The Wire and that&rsquo;s when I knew it was Dominic West. Amazing. So came in and Matthew was brilliant he just, we were all sitting down and we had tea and he as just asking Nigel and I to tell about our histories and how we met and just, you know, our politics blah blah blah, which we did. Then after about an hour or so Matthew, Stephen said: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take Dominic out to see your garden?&rdquo; &lsquo;Cause he knew how I loved the garden. So, we did. We just went out and chatted, he&rsquo;s really, just a&hellip; A genuinely lovely lovely mensch. And that was great and I suppose if there are any characteristics of mine in the film then he got them from, you know, outside in the garden. But yeah, so&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I think that there is so much misinformation and I think what is really, really important to understand is that we now have, we have no medic- no no vaccines, you know, it is amazing around this COVID the difference between HIV and COVID in terms that COVID there&rsquo;s been this vaccine in no time at all, whereas, you know, there is no vaccine for HIV, for whatever the reasons and I think that it&rsquo;s probably because COVID is so quick, in terms of you get it and you present symptoms and then: bang. Whereas HIV is a slow-burn, so it can take at least 18 months before you necessarily show any signs and even then it becomes a longer way, I think, of actually getting ill and your T-cells being depleted and opportunistic infections&hellip; And there is, you know, amazing advances that have been made in medication...
</p>
<p>
I have a theory about why these advances in medicine materialised when they did. When Thatcher was told by Norman Fowler - the health minister at the time - that HIV had entered the heterosexual community, she freaked. What he didn't tell her was that it was in the heterosexual intravenous drug users of Edinburgh. If she&rsquo;d have known, I don't think she&rsquo;d have acted quite so quickly.
</p>
<p>
But the big thing is this whole thing around stigma and that is the battle. That is what needs to be waged. And I think it&rsquo;s really important and that&rsquo;s what I think is so important about this project, is that the more that we talk about it, the more that we&rsquo;re able to be open about it, the more that people get to understand it that we don&rsquo;t have three heads, that, you know, it is incredibly difficult to pass this virus, it requires, sort of, you know, the needle-stick or just, you know, some way that it&rsquo;s got to get into the bloodstream, whether it&rsquo;s sexually or what-have-you, you know. So&hellip; But, there is so much misinformation that this stigma has appeared and it is the stigma and sometimes it&rsquo;s self-stigma that it is what needs to be battled and the way I think, the best way of battling it is in terms of talking about it and, you know, it&rsquo;s in a way the forgotten epidemic, because there is the medication, you know, which is fine for, you know, people in the West who get access to it but there are you know, loads of countries that don&rsquo;t have access to it or that the drug companies have, you know, patents and they make fortunes from it, you know, whereas there are amazing, generic drugs which are relatively, in comparison, inexpensive. Well, that is what is needed and, you know, it&rsquo;s like really important that these vaccines, you know, become, you know, accessible to everybody. Globally accessible, not just to the rich countries around. So, I think that, for me, the most important thing around HIV is about stigma and is about dealing with stigma and is about talking about it and getting people to understand, you know, that&hellip; Yep.
</p>
<p>
I&rsquo;m passionate about educating the next generation about living with HIV. I&rsquo;m one of the Terrence Higgins Trust&rsquo;s Positive Voices, and I visit schools to talk about the misconceptions surrounding the disease. Sex education was so damaged after Section 28, the law enacted by Margaret Thatcher prohibiting schools from &lsquo;promoting&rsquo; of homosexuality. I think it&rsquo;s still damaged, but what's amazing is the number of young people that know their sexuality and are out. That is phenomenal.
</p>
<p>
When I was diagnosed, I didn't think I&rsquo;d have a life. And if I hadn't have made the choice to go on that demonstration and meet Nigel, I can&rsquo;t imagine how it would be.
</p>
<p>
How do I feel when people call me an inspiration? I&rsquo;m just lucky. I&rsquo;m flattered. I just live my life the only way I know how.
