<p>Andy&rsquo;s Story.</p>
<p>
 Hi, my name&rsquo;s Andy, I&rsquo;m 55 years old. I&rsquo;ve been living with HIV since 2008. My home is my safe space, er, I love it, it reflects me a lot I feel and, yeah, it&rsquo;s a real pleasure to have you here.
</p>
<p>
 Where should I start? Interesting question. I guess, right now, I&rsquo;m thinking&hellip; Grew up in the Midlands &lsquo;til I was thirteen, then moved to mid-Wales to a rural hamlet which was, had five houses, grandparents lived in the next village, five miles away but as a gay person moving at the age of thirteen from the Midlands where I had lots of friends, to a new school. Sexuality, lots of comments at school. My surname&rsquo;s Ray so my nickname at school was &lsquo;gay Ray&rsquo;, but you know people in the village, sort of, talking about other people in the village that I knew were, sort of, very feminine so they&rsquo;d make comments like &lsquo;don&rsquo;t bend over, fairy George is coming&rsquo; and y&rsquo;know, there was just all of that. And then going to college, sort of, trained to be a chef. Never had any intentions of moving to London, bar, in my last year at training there was a guy who&rsquo;d moved to London the year before and wanted two people to go and work for him at Christmas, so me and this girl Tracey went down to London, that would be &lsquo;85. Worked and I was just like, in Wembley at this hotel, and I was like: &lsquo;oh my god&rsquo;. The first night sitting in the boot of a, well it was a hatchback Ford Fiesta, er, Ford Escort, going down Charing Cross Road at like midnight, thinking: &lsquo;What the fuck?&rsquo; So I worked there for two weeks for Christmas went back with less money than I arrived. Then went back to college, did the last six months Did a week&rsquo;s industrial release in London and then, two, two three days after finishing college moved to London. And then was it.
</p>
<p>
 Twenty-three years in London doing sort of various jobs but always in hospitality and then moved to Bristol in 2008. But I got my diagnosis three months after moving here.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
... the diagnosis was just like put the brakes on how I&rsquo;d been living life. Yeah. So, it was, yeah, it was a complete shock in some ways but not in others. I wasn&rsquo;t surprised at all once I got it, but when I did actually get it&hellip; Yeah, only because of how I received the diagnosis, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;d been to the clinic in the morning at like 10 o&rsquo;clock for my results because I&rsquo;d been for a full check-up two weeks prior. Went at 10 o&rsquo;clock and they went: &ldquo;Yeah, everything&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; and then in the afternoon I got a phone- I was getting ready for work and there was a voicemail message fom the clinic asking me to give them a call, so I was a bit like: &lsquo;Oh, okay.&rsquo; So I gave them a call and was like, this was December the 22nd and I was like: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to Wales tomorrow to see the family for Christmas, can it wait &lsquo;til afterwards?&rdquo; And they were like: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And then I was like: &ldquo;Do you wanna see me now?&rdquo; And they were like: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; So I went: &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; I was like: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just getting ready for work but I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo; So I rang work, said I&rsquo;d got to do something. Went straight there and literally walked in and they were just like: &ldquo;Really sorry we missed you this morning, but your HIV results came back positive.&rdquo; I mean, even now, looking back, you know, they said: &ldquo;Is there everything okay? Have you got any questions?&rdquo; And I was a bit like: &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; &lsquo;Cause I was like, y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s just surreal, it wasn&rsquo;t like, wow, fucking hell. 10 o&rsquo;clock this morning everything was fine. And I, I&hellip; My best friends who I was living with, one of them he was like: &ldquo;Give me a call afterwards.&rdquo; Because he was like &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; when I was leaving, &ldquo;oh, got to go to the clinic.&rdquo; So he rang and he was like: &ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; And I went: &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, no, it&rsquo;s all fine.&rdquo; And he went: &ldquo;No it&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; And I went: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;I can tell by your voice.&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;Oh, no, I&rsquo;m HIV-positive.&rdquo; And he was like: &ldquo;Okay. Er, you know, fine. Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo; And I said: &ldquo;No, going to work.&rdquo; So I went off to work, did my shift, came home, was a, had a long chat with both of them, just talked about it but, y&rsquo;know, at that point there was, you&rsquo;re still absorbing it. And then the next day I drove to mid-Wales. Literally just arrived in the small town where my parents and brothers live, pulled up, saw my one brother on the side of the road with his wife and three kids and the phone rang and I was like: &ldquo;Oh, erm erm, oh, I&rsquo;ve got to take this, I&rsquo;ve just got to go because the signal&rsquo;s not very good here.&rdquo; Which was ridiculous because the phone was ringing. Drove off to the local car park, sort of answered it and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got to move,&rdquo; so, whatever, drove to the car park and then spoke to them and I was a bit like: &lsquo;Oh, god, that was so stupid.&rdquo; But, like, and they were like: &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s positive and, y&rsquo;know, now obviously it&rsquo;s Christmas, New Year, so we&rsquo;ll get you an appointment at Southmead in the New Year.&rdquo; So, which was also just a bit weird, because it was that whole, like, you&rsquo;ve just left. And I was staying with my parents. So, fortunately on Christmas Day I was with my cousin and my Mum and Dad and his M- his Dad, for Christmas Day. And my Gran. And I ended up going back to my cousin&rsquo;s, getting really drunk with him in afternoon and just was like: &ldquo;I need to talk to you.&rdquo; So, he was the second person I told and it was great, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m really close to him. And we just sat there and chatted and got more drunk. So that was perfect.
</p>
<p>
 I obviously went to work. I was working in a restaurant in Bath at the time, so it was Christmas, we were busy. That night wasn&rsquo;t as busy, because it was the last night before we closed so there was just a few people in. But, I guess I was used to the routine so it was that sort of like &lsquo;drive to Bath, go to work, do the job.&rsquo; No-one asked so I obviously managed to just do the job, yeah. It was really, I mean, and even, y&rsquo;know, the next day I was, like, driving to my parents and, y&rsquo;know, that was all fine and to be honest actually even through that whole first period which was, I would say, first couple of months, I was thinking about it constantly. I mean I know the one thing that initially when I came out of the clinic I just imagined this was it, like this was the end. I&rsquo;m going to die. And that feeling stayed with me for a while. And then, y&rsquo;know&hellip; I think if I hadn&rsquo;t have had my cousin to talk to and just sort of get drunk and get it all out and just talk to him, it probably would have been different. I mean I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get back from my parents&rsquo;, I couldn&rsquo;t wait for Christmas to be over and I had that weird feeling sort of from getting the diagnosis to my first appointment, which was mid-January, of this feeling of like &lsquo;I know I&rsquo;ve got it but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ve got it.&rsquo; I was thinking about, y&rsquo;know, who do I need to tell? Actually, when I left London and I came to Bristol, there was a gap, there was a three-month period in between where I left London, I came to Bristol, but then I went to Spain for three months actually. So I had three months in Spain &lsquo;cause I was thinking of going travelling and whatever. And actually that&rsquo;s three months before my diagnosis, thinking about it. So it&rsquo;s&hellip; It was because the three months I was also in, in Spain, I was going out and I was clubbing and I was whatever, so there was, there was one particular night and I think there is a possibility that if I hadn&rsquo;t caught it before, that could have been when I got it. Because of what we did. So, I had to phone that person and tell them. Who was particularly angry on the phone and then just put the phone down, but I was a bit like: &ldquo;Well, y&rsquo;know, we did what we did and I know what you do with many other people.&rdquo; So, at the end of the day I was a bit like: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done the right thing.&rsquo; It was actually a very transitional point, so the diagnosis came - looking back now - I feel like the diagnosis came at exactly the right time. If there was ever a right time for it to arrive. But the fact that, y&rsquo;know, because it made me put the brakes on and as, y&rsquo;know, that&rsquo;s the only way I can see it, I sort of compare it to, which could be right or wrong, being an alcoholic and waking up and, y&rsquo;know, just that morning of thinking: &lsquo;This has to stop.&rsquo; I was a bit like&hellip; I&rsquo;d already made the decision to leave London I, y&rsquo;know, I knew the clubbing had to stop, I knew the drinking&hellip; The drinking and the drugs were causing the depressions, which, I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the depressions, and&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t really have any feeling of home because actually the three years that I was living here at that point I was renting a room in a friend&rsquo;s house, so, I never really had that feeling of home anywhere because I&rsquo;ve always rented and I&rsquo;ve always lived in other people&rsquo;s homes so my feeling of home has always been &ndash; and still is &ndash; that I&rsquo;ve never quite found my home yet. Where I am now, here, where I&rsquo;ve been four years, going into the fourth year, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve lived on my own for this length of time. So this is the closest I&rsquo;ve felt to being at home. But that period, I think I&rsquo;ve always been looking. But, for some reason never found home or thought&hellip; I mean, I know why now, I can&hellip; About four years ago, I did a test to find out if I had dyslexia and I do. So, that was never something when I went to school was never picked up on. Part of having dyslexia is that you find ways of coping with it, so I&rsquo;ve looked into buying houses with so many people and talked about buying a place together but it&rsquo;s never actually happened. And part of it&rsquo;s always been around sort of just that coping strategy of &lsquo;can I do it? How do I do it?&rsquo; And using other people to, sort of, cover up my, sort of, fears. Having got the diagnosis now and living here and sort of dealing with all the stuff I&rsquo;ve dealt with here, of actually living on your own and being with yourself has, y&rsquo;know, that&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;s definitely a positive.
</p>
<p>
 And then it was like, you know, you have that other thing around we&rsquo;re so conditioned in this country to having your own place and I grew up in a family that bought houses, renovated them, sold them and moved on. And there was, y&rsquo;know, I&rsquo;ve got four brothers, I&rsquo;m the eldest. So I sort of feel like, you know, I always felt like I&rsquo;d failed by not having my own house but living in London that didn&rsquo;t really matter because there was that sort of like: you live in London.
</p>
<p>
 It was amazing but, y&rsquo;know, there&rsquo;s a part of me that feels like it went on a bit too long. But you don&rsquo;t know how to get out of it either. I knew I wasn&rsquo;t in a great space when I left, so yeah&hellip; But yeah now, I&rsquo;m like, sort of, even now I mean I rent this place and I know they&rsquo;re going to sell it in two years so all&rsquo;s that on my mind is: &lsquo;How&hellip; you know.&rsquo; I&rsquo;d love to, sort of, possibly do a self-build because I mean, the one thing that I&rsquo;ve got is, y&rsquo;know, I don&rsquo;t need a huge place, y&rsquo;know, and to be honest I don&rsquo;t need something that&rsquo;s gonna be, y&rsquo;know, passed onto anybody. So there&rsquo;s that weird feeling of like &lsquo;well it doesn&rsquo;t need to be passed on because I don&rsquo;t have children, there&rsquo;s no-one to pass it on to&rsquo;, or whatever, but at the same time I just want something for me. But then, can you afford to do that? And what do you do?
</p>
<p>
 You know, living here&rsquo;s being great because I&rsquo;ve dealt with all the &lsquo;can I live on my own?&rsquo; Yes, I can. Do I enjoy living on my own? Yeah. Do I love creating a space that feels like home? And this is mine.
</p>
<p>
 Well, where do I feel at home now is Bristol. And that&rsquo;s lovely because leaving London and being here, I was here for three years after my diagnosis and for those three years as I said I worked at Aqua. I then went to Spain for three months to open a restaurant with a friend of mine but realised that wasn&rsquo;t going to work and then ended up going back to mid-Wales and living in the area where I&rsquo;d grown up and where my family was and actually spent two years sharing a house with my youngest brother because he had separated from his wife, in the town where my parents lived which was brilliant in so many ways, but at the same time the whole time I was there I just felt like, actually rural life wasn&rsquo;t for me. Living there wasn&rsquo;t for me. And I really missed&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t miss London, but I missed living in Bristol. But what did happen whilst I was there, I started working for myself and started working in doing odd-jobs which then led to gardening and then led to what I do now. But from a home point-of-view I felt like I reconnected with Wales as an adult and I also left as an adult.
</p>
<p>
 So, it&rsquo;s a one-bedroom flat. It&rsquo;s quite small. It&rsquo;s in the&hellip; It was a three-storey house which has been converted, so I&rsquo;ve got the lower ground. It&rsquo;s quite quirky.
</p>
<p>
 So in the lounge I&rsquo;ve got two walls which I&rsquo;ve painted with a&hellip; It&rsquo;s called green-smoke, it&rsquo;s a Farrow and Ball colour. And then in the kitchen I&rsquo;ve got, also got a heather colour, so&hellip; Yeah, the tones are picked up from that. And it&rsquo;s got quite old furniture in it and the reason being when I lived in London and when I first moved here... I look back and I had all very sort of chrome-legged tables with glass tops. It was all about image plastic sort of Perspex chairs, coffee tables and, y&rsquo;know, that whole transition now from working in hospitality to now working as a gardener, landscaper, doing painting and decorating, my home sort of reflects that because I&rsquo;ve gone for much more rustic, there&rsquo;s blocks of wood in the corner which are sort of sleepers. They&rsquo;re cut-offs from sleepers which we built the beds in gardens with but where we&rsquo;ve done angled beds and the wood&rsquo;s cut with an angle, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re there because they remind me of the garden they were built in.
</p>
<p>
 And then the other thing is there are a lot of things in here which are all about memories, so people and places and things I&rsquo;ve done. So there&rsquo;s a Moroccan transcript on the wall in the picture frame, which&hellip; My friend Maria lived in Marrakesh so I used to go and stay with her and I also had the restaurant with her in Spain. So I bought that when I was with her at one point. There&rsquo;s a lovely old water jug in the corner. That was my Grandmother&rsquo;s and growing up my Mum had it on the, on the oak dining table in the hallway and it was always full with flowers. So when I did move back to Wales my Mum asked me what things I would like from her Mum, if there was anything in particular. So I said that&rsquo;s one thing, because it always just reminds me of being at home. And so she gave it to me when I decided to move back to Bristol. Which was lovely. The table at my side and the stool was my Gran&rsquo;s which is my Dad&rsquo;s mother and she passed away about a year-and-a-half ago and she was just over a hundred. So, when I used to, I mean, I was closest to her my whole life. So in the last house that she lived in this was her dining table and whenever I went to visit we used to have our meals at it but I know that she had all of her breakfast, lunch and dinner at it, every day. And I used to sit on the stool. And so, y&rsquo;know, just little things like that.
</p>
<p>
 I sort of feel now rather than buying materialistic stuff I tend to pick stuff up when I&rsquo;m out walking, whether I&rsquo;m at work and stuff, so it&rsquo;s got to be a real homely feel to it. And I think that&rsquo;s why I use old furniture now because I&rsquo;m a bit like, y&rsquo;know, particularly where we are these days in... One of the things that I.. Even so doing the landscaping it&rsquo;s really lovely, we&rsquo;ve got such a culture of &lsquo;rip it out, throw it away, start again&rsquo;, when there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it.
</p>
<p>
 &hellip; in some ways it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s been a positive because it was so difficult at the beginning that I was like: &lsquo;How do I tell people?&rsquo; And for me it was around, if I look back it was about self-stigma and partly because I&rsquo;d lost two friends, one in &lsquo;94 and one in &lsquo;95. And I always, I just felt like I&rsquo;d let myself down. So my relationship is with me is really why I&rsquo;m, is probably why I&rsquo;m saying that because that had the affect on relationships with other people. So i.e. family. So whilst I was going through the two years of therapy with Pete one of the biggest things in the first twelve months was telling my parents. And that was to do with I remember telling my parents when I was gay that.. I went home when I was about 21 and I told them and I told my Father and he told my Mum. My Mum was very upset. I sort of spoke to my Dad and he was like, y&rsquo;know: &lsquo;Oh it&rsquo;s okay but we don&rsquo;t have to tell&hellip; You know, we don&rsquo;t have to have a big party and tell everybody.&rdquo; And so it was never really discussed for another five years until one of my brothers was coming to London to stay with me. And I was like: &lsquo;Oh, shit, I need to go home.&rsquo; So over the years my relationship with family and stuff was in a good place. To then have to tell them I was positive I just felt like, partly it was they&rsquo;re gonna be like: &lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not surprised, it&rsquo;s sort of, y&rsquo;know, you&rsquo;re gay, you live in London, it&rsquo;s like, y&rsquo;know, oh it&rsquo;s inevitable.&rsquo; And at the same time I was like, I don&rsquo;t want to upset them, I don&rsquo;t want to hurt them, I don&rsquo;t want them to be, y&rsquo;know, constantly worried about it because I know what my Mum&rsquo;s like, she can worry about a lot of stuff. So, I knew I needed to be in the right place to tell them. So in the end I sort of told my brothers as in, I went through my brothers. So I told one, my youngest one who I was closest to. I then told my next brother because he was closest to my parents and so I thought they would be able to deal with it. And then the third one and then the next was my parents. But, even with them I went home and didn&rsquo;t tell them. I&rsquo;d psyched myself up. I got all the way there, I stayed for the couple of days and then I was like: &lsquo;Oh, fuck, no. I can&rsquo;t do it, I can&rsquo;t do it.&rsquo; Left and I was driving away thinking: &lsquo;Oh fuck, I need to turn around and go and tell them, no I can&rsquo;t because I&rsquo;ve got to go back to work.&rsquo; Next week I rang them and I was like: &ldquo;Hi, just going to pop up and see you.&rdquo; And they were like: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the caravan, we&rsquo;re at Brecon.&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;Oh, okay, no no, it&rsquo;s alright then.&rdquo; And my Dad was like: &ldquo;No, no, the, we&rsquo;ve got the awning on the caravan you can come and see us and it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;No, no, no, no.&rdquo; And he was, like, so insistent and I was sort of like: &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; So, yeah, I drove to Brecon. I arrived at the caravan. They knew there was something wrong.
</p>
<p>
 I had no intention of sitting in the caravan about two foot away from them to tell them but that&rsquo;s what happened. We were sitting in there in the caravan Mum and Dad on one seat on the other side with the dog and me on the opposite side and it was like polite chat and then I was like, y&rsquo;know: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got something to tell you.&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m HIV-positive.&rdquo; It was like: &ldquo;Oh, oh, right, okay.&rdquo; Well, then they were sort of like, Mum said: &ldquo;I thought maybe you&rsquo;d got cancer or something, y&rsquo;know, it&rsquo;s okay and&hellip;&rdquo; And I said: &ldquo;Well, y&rsquo;know&hellip;&rdquo; And we talked about it and actually they were fine. And&hellip; I said that I&rsquo;d brought some information for them, in case they had any questions and stuff so I left the information with them, well&hellip; Well, I gave it to them. And then the funny thing was my Dad sort of was like, y&rsquo;know, I guess this was over about an hour. My Dad was like: &ldquo;Well, shall we go out and get something to eat.&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;Yeah, okay.&rdquo; And as I walked out of the caravan he was like: &ldquo;Oh well we don&rsquo;t need to discuss this again.&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;Er, yes we do.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;The whole point in telling you is in case we need to discuss this again.&rdquo; And I just thought: &lsquo;We are not going through what we went through when I came out. We&rsquo;re not having another five years of no fucking discussion.&rsquo; This is, like, you know: no. This is not the same&hellip; In a way, I think it was that sort of, like, because I really did feel like I had let myself down, in a way, because I&rsquo;d been so sort of&hellip; I guess it&rsquo;s like so many things when you sort of put this in your head that, you know, you&rsquo;re always going to be careful, you&rsquo;re not going to catch anything, you&rsquo;re not going to, y&rsquo;know&hellip; And, y&rsquo;know, I guess if I&rsquo;m completely honest the other side of it I know there were times that I wasn&rsquo;t taking precaution and I wasn&rsquo;t being careful and I knew I wasn&rsquo;t being careful and do I know why? No. It&rsquo;s just&hellip; It was the moment, that&rsquo;s what it was. And did I, afterwards, think about it? Yes. But I think there were times where it was like, also, it was a bit like: &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ve done it before and I was okay, so&hellip;&rsquo; Y&rsquo;know?
</p>
<p>
 &hellip; there&rsquo;s, you know, I mean, just thinking about all the things we&rsquo;ve talked about now, this, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so vocal because I&rsquo;m a bit like, yeah, I&rsquo;ve lived in London, I&rsquo;ve lived in mid-Wales, I know what the stigma was like in mid-Wales, I know so much that I sort of feel like, and particularly right now that we&rsquo;re in another, you know, we&rsquo;re in a pandemic that it&rsquo;s like, you know, things are so different because of&hellip; it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s, okay coronavirus isn&rsquo;t a sexually-transmitted disease but, you know, it&rsquo;s another virus. It is just a virus. And HIV was a virus but it was never portrayed as a virus, just a virus, it was, you know, that&rsquo;s what has ignited me to be even more vocal in a way. But, you know, now the fact that all my friends know. I guess the biggest thing I&rsquo;m thinking right now from in a relationship because I do mentoring, is what I tell new people and it would be my experiences, you know. You don&rsquo;t need to tell everyone. It&rsquo;s actually to think why you&rsquo;re telling people and understand really why you&rsquo;re telling people. That&rsquo;s the difference. There&rsquo;s people I&rsquo;ve told in the past and I&rsquo;m like if I look at it now I&rsquo;d be like: &lsquo;Do I tell them now? No way.&rsquo; I mean I told people from da- from a dating point which was definitely a challenge moving back to live rurally and tell people because I felt like if I met people on apps and then they turned up that I should tell them. I didn&rsquo;t want to tell them and then we&rsquo;d have a conversation, but most of the response that I got was: &lsquo;Ah, okay, you know, oh no. Sorry.&rsquo; So, sex was out of the question and it was just like polite chat and nice, sort of, coffee and then off they&rsquo;d go. And you&rsquo;re sort of, like&hellip; [laughter &ndash; &lsquo;sorry&rsquo;] No, it&rsquo;s, it was &hellip; Because for me it was, you know, at that point u-equals-u wasn&rsquo;t out and I just didn&rsquo;t want to have that feeling of if there&rsquo;s somebody that I&rsquo;ve told that happened to know them and they found out, that I hadn&rsquo;t been honest. And I just thought, you know, even if we use protection I always felt that I should be honest. And that was, you know, that was just my feeling. But I remember getting a job in a local cafe and the woman who ran it was a nurse and her son was a chef but I, and I even said to her: &ldquo;But if I cut myself, you know, I&rsquo;m HIV-positive.&rdquo; And it was like&hellip; Not that she could really catch it but I still felt, you know, even with my family or anyone, you know, if I cut myself that I should be the one that dealt with it and I, you know, to make them aware. It was just&hellip; In a way it was a caution, but it also made it feel like there was something wrong as well. Like I, you know, you couldn&rsquo;t just cut yourself and someone sort of could just bandage it up.
</p>
<p>
 But it&rsquo;s still that sort of, even that shame in a way that&hellip; You feel like you&rsquo;ve come so far but then little things like that still make you feel like there is some shame in it, there is some sort of&hellip; And I do wonder whether that&rsquo;s also tied in with just how &ndash; not so much these days &ndash; but growing up as a gay person, was, you know, sort of, what you grow up with even as a young gay person coming out. The fact that you have to come out and you go through that whole sort of process of, you know, constantly having to come out and then constantly having to, it&rsquo;s like, the whole coming-out period just starts all over again and you spend your whole life, sort of, not only just coming out but having to then be on hon- well not just honest but telling people about being positive. And that&rsquo;s the biggest thing I feel now has changed. Now I feel like with u-equals-u that I am vo- so vocal about it from that point because I sort of feel like I don&rsquo;t want other people to have to go through this. And I&rsquo;m like it&rsquo;s so simple it&rsquo;s, you know, the message&hellip; U-equals-u, even for me was the biggest game-changer&hellip; Because I think, that&rsquo;s another thing that looking back, I was talking about it the other week to someone, you know the fact that people start meds immediately now, so, you know, thinking from when I was diagnosed and you were going for your check-ups every three months and, you know, they were looking at your CD4 count so first of all you get your diagnosis and once you&rsquo;ve had your diagnosis you go for your check-ups and you&rsquo;re getting used to that. But then you&rsquo;re also monitoring your CD4 count come down to the point that it&rsquo;s like: &lsquo;Okay, now we&rsquo;re going to start you on meds.&rsquo; So you&rsquo;ve got that feeling inside of: &lsquo;Okay, am I at a point that I&rsquo;m getting to the point that I&rsquo;m seriously ill enough? If it&rsquo;s not seriously ill if it goes further where there could be more complications, so now I&rsquo;m starting.&rsquo; Whereas now getting your diagnosis and starting on meds immediately, that whole thing, part of it has been removed. You know, you just don&rsquo;t have to go through that, sort of, worry&hellip; But from a&hellip; from a point of&hellip; It&rsquo;s an interesting one because I guess having been single for so long part of what I am stumbling across at the moment is that very point. Is that the negativity from dating apps and just dating in general is probably stopped me from dating as much. And put a, just a block on it, to the point whereas I feel like I&rsquo;m just sort of, in the last couple of years, starting again and the more comfortable I&rsquo;ve become over the years with it&hellip; and bizarrely u-equals-u. I think u-equals-u - and I hadn&rsquo;t realised &ndash; that the negativity really that surrounds dating, particularly moving back to mid-Wales and just that whole&hellip; Y&rsquo;know, you only need like five or six people over a period of time to just constantly be going: &lsquo;No, no, no, no.&rsquo; And, sorry.

 And then just responses from people as well with dating. You sort of get to to that point of&hellip; You know, it&rsquo;s easier not to in some ways. But then you get the other side when you suddenly meet someone and, you know, they&rsquo;re perfectly just like: &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; And you&rsquo;re like: &ldquo;Oh god, why have I&hellip; What&rsquo;s been going on?&rdquo; To a point now that I guess I feel in such a good place that I&rsquo;m like questioning why I&rsquo;ve been single for so long in a way and what&hellip; Am I sort of stopping myself from being in a relationship or even just going out and meeting people.
</p>
<p>
 And I guess it&rsquo;s, you know, the difficulty is in when you meet someone who potentially you could date, but due to what&rsquo;s going on in their own life they just, the HIV is too big for them to cope with and then they can&rsquo;t. And then that also has a really big impact because then you&rsquo;re sort of like: &lsquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a person who I possibly could have a really&hellip;&rsquo; In your head you&rsquo;re going: &lsquo;Well, I could have a really good relationship, it could all be great. Why don&rsquo;t you want to deal with it? Why can&rsquo;t you deal with it?&rsquo; But actually they just can&rsquo;t. Because of where they are. And that, you know, you don&rsquo;t sort of realise how long simple things can actually take to just move on from, because of the layers of other stuff behind that build up.

 I guess it was 2000 and &ndash; It was 2016 when Brigstowe was 21 and it did it&rsquo;s twenty-first anniversary and they held it at Bordeaux Quay and for me, I think that was the first time, I&rsquo;d only done a couple of things with Brigstowe but I was on their mailing list so I got invited, but I remember it being the very first time of&hellip; Going to an HIV event outside of the space i.e. THT always held things that they did actually in the THT offices, behind closed doors and I always felt it was a bit, sort of, closed whereas walking into Bordeaux Quay and going, you know: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for the Brigstowe event.&rdquo; And it was like: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s upstairs.&rdquo; And it was like: &lsquo;Oh wow. I&rsquo;m in Bristol, I&rsquo;m HIV-positive but I&rsquo;m going into, sort of, the city centre. It was like: &lsquo;Bloody hell.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve always been part of THT, but I remember from then going to Pride and going with Brigstowe and I remember walking through the centre of the city in front of everyone, just sort of walking up &lsquo;round where Harvey Nicks is and up to the Galleries car park and just coming around that corner and I was there with my placard saying: &lsquo;HIV does not discriminate.&rsquo; And every&hellip; the Brigstowe crowd was all behind me and THT behind me and there was a bit of gap and seeing a photographer on the wall taking photographs and thinking: &lsquo;Fucking hell. How far my life has come, that I can walk through the city like this and remembering standing outside Aqua watching the first Pride, even so I know there was Prides before but there was a period when there wasn&rsquo;t, coming from the fountains just literally along Baldwin Street into Castle Park and sort of feeling like actually I couldn&rsquo;t, I couldn&rsquo;t go to it &lsquo;cause I working at Aqua. I was working but I still didn&rsquo;t feel like part of Bristol, which goes back to the last question. I never felt that in London. Never felt excluded at all. But that was&hellip; I still didn&rsquo;t feel like I was part of Bristol at that point.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe it was because I was in London for so long. And actually when I come here I was still going through that sort of &lsquo;why am I here?&rsquo; So, we&rsquo;re&hellip; I guess we&rsquo;re talking if it was 2008, 9, 2010, around then when the first Pride was and I didn&rsquo;t really know that many people and I guess if it was because I was working at Aqua and most of my life was work, I didn&rsquo;t really know anyone to go with. So there was that sort of, y&rsquo;know, feeling of exclusion in a way. &lsquo;Cause I only really had Aqua and my only sort of connection with the gay scene was my diagnosis and when I went to THT and doing meetings there. I didn&rsquo;t really do anything outside.
</p>
<p>
 There was a, there was a&hellip; I know there&rsquo;d been Prides before and then for some reason &ndash; I guess it was funding, or whatever, but there wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; then there was the first one and I think then there as the first few that started and they only went from, I&rsquo;m sure, where the fountains are, along Baldwin Street, into Castle Park. And there was a part of me in, in that way of going: &lsquo;Oh my god, is that it?&rsquo; And I&rsquo;ve total shame in saying that but it&rsquo;s like let&rsquo;s be honest I had lived in London for twenty-three years and it was a bit like&hellip; But then I was like, you know, now I look back and I think &lsquo;good on them&rsquo;. Because fucking hell, they had the balls to actually be there and march. Y&rsquo;know, and I didn&rsquo;t. And actually there&rsquo;s a part of&hellip; So, you know, looking at how Pride has grown now, I love it.
</p>
<p>
 I feel like there&rsquo;s the me I sometimes imagine in my head is what I&rsquo;m like but actually when people meet me I&rsquo;m very open, very honest, incredibly chatty, love to talk&hellip; And love to know stuff about, you know, people. So, yeah I&rsquo;ll chat to anyone. If I meet them in the street or wherever, you know. And hugely empathetic to people and my dyslexia makes me incredibly reflective because the dyslexic side of me has to, when, when I&rsquo;m asked things and stuff, I need to think about it and sometimes it can be &lsquo;I need to go away and think about it&rsquo;, depending on what it is, if it&rsquo;s, I dunno, a certain project or something that&rsquo;s coming up. And I think my talking side is, that&rsquo;s how I get my information out. So, if you asked me to write down everything that I talk about I&rsquo;d sit there and be absolutely sort of like stuck in a: no. I mean, I could talk about in a way. So, I think in the past there&rsquo;s been this person who&rsquo;s been quite shy and sometimes quite reserved and the alcohol and the drugs allowed me to be the person that was sort of afraid of being me, at that time in the past. But I think the diagnosis of, my HIV diagnosis has been such a journey that that has been one of the best things that&rsquo;s ever happened to me, because it put the brakes on me living the life how I was and made me really delve into the depths of who I am and what were my insecurities and my fears and why was I using the drugs and the alcohol and I guess &lsquo;cause it went on for so long I can quite easily see myself at times when, you know, I&rsquo;d be afraid of things yet put me in a club and a few vodkas and suddenly I&rsquo;m like: &lsquo;Oh my god, yeah, hello! Yeah, here I am.&rdquo; But put me in a club and introduce me to twenty people when I was sober I&rsquo;d want to shrink away and hide in the corner and, sort of, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to speak to anyone. Or put me in a club even, you know, I&rsquo;d be the one dancing on the edge whereas now I&rsquo;d be the one dancing in the middle, you know, and I do my Positive Voices speaking and my mentoring. Out of everything the mentoring and the positive speaking has been the one that&rsquo;s brought me out the most because it&rsquo;s just the realisation that, you know, all my experiences I can help other people in so many different ways because it&rsquo;s not just to do with HIV. It&rsquo;s who you&rsquo;ve worked with, who you&rsquo;ve known. The drugs, the drinking, the therapy enables me to support people now, but also to do an interview like this, to do the Bristol Post piece as well and to share it on my Facebook. And to actually, whoever I&rsquo;m talking to now, say that I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got HIV.
</p>
<p>
 I think it&rsquo;s one of those things where it sparked something in me and I could go and do more but there&rsquo;s a part of me that also feels that, you know, if it was the right time I&rsquo;d be doing it. So, you know, the other thing I&rsquo;ve, I feel like I&rsquo;m a sort of spiritual person as well and I think the landscaping and the gardening has just highlighted and brought that out. So, I think moving back to mid-Wales, you know, I&rsquo;ve got one garden that I started working on when I first got back there and I still go back every three weeks and look after that garden, because the lady who owns it is unable to get into the garden so I go and do it and I&rsquo;ve been doing it now for nine years. Yeah, it feels like it&rsquo;s my garden but we share it and that&rsquo;s my sort of spiritual place when I&rsquo;m there. And I get to see my family as well so it&rsquo;s got a double bonus.
</p>
<p>
 And now, you know, there&rsquo;s&hellip; I guess the difficulty at the moment is with the new strain I&rsquo;m being cautious about where I work because I tend to do small jobs , go in and out of places, but yeah&hellip; It&rsquo;s also working on my own is bringing out some of my insecurities, so I guess that&rsquo;s the big thing with me is that, you know, the&hellip; You can be so confident on one side and so sort of spoken and chatty yet you still have that trouble with insecurities as well.
</p>
<p>
 What&rsquo;s my safe space? Gardening, being self-employed. Even so though that&rsquo;s a challenge, you know, that&rsquo;s an interesting one because being self-employed you have to have the confidence to deliver the work that you do. To get new clients. To sell yourself. And I guess what&rsquo;s interesting that I see now is having worked in hospitality for so long and also growing up in a family who bought, sold, renovated property we were very hands-on and at the time you think, you know: &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s given me so many life-skills, that I can do.&rsquo; What holds me back at times are my insecurities and those are the ones where I&rsquo;m like being a mentor then challenges me how I mentor myself because mentoring is a symbiotic relationship because you go and support somebody and then you have to look at things that&rsquo;s going on in your own life and go: &lsquo;Hm. But why, what&rsquo;s going on here and how to I deal with this?&rsquo; Yeah, and work through it. And understand&hellip; And really understand yourself. I mean, I&rsquo;ve got invoices there and I&rsquo;ve got paperwork and I&rsquo;ve got diaries and I&rsquo;ve got money that people owe me for work that I&rsquo;ve done and the safe space is doing the gardening because I can go and do the work. The difficulty in, for me, which is just bizarre, to send an email or text message telling them what they owe me. And it really takes me back to why I&rsquo;m not working in hospitality, not working in corporate job and I&rsquo;m not looking at spreadsheets. That&rsquo;s not my safe space.
</p>
<p>
 And my home. I guess my home now has, is me. And it reflects me. And I like it. And I guess that&rsquo;s the next bit in my chapter, in my safe space I need to push myself out of my safe space. Because, yes I&rsquo;d like to meet somebody. Yes, it&rsquo;d be lovely to be in a relationship and sort of share all of this and share the fears as well of being in a relationship after being single for so long. Because my safe space is being single and not having to push myself outside those boundaries.
</p>
<p>
 But you&rsquo;ve also got your fears when you open it, you know, there&rsquo;s still those&hellip; And that&rsquo;s what I find really fascinating. So I love doing personal development workshops and still just pushing myself.

<p>
 Patrice I was in a sort-of relationship for three years when I was&hellip; I was twenty-one and I met him at the Market Tavern one Sunday afternoon. And I remember him coming over to me and sort of going: &ldquo;You look so petrified.&rdquo; &lsquo;Cause I was standing there, it was the first time I&rsquo;d been to the Market Tavern. It was a Sunday afternoon. A friend of mine had taken me, a guy called Simon, who I shared a room with in a house with five other people. So, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s A Sin&rsquo; has just been brilliant because I was just like: &lsquo;Oh my god!&rsquo; And Patrice was like, you know: &ldquo;Do you want to come back to my place?&rdquo; And I was like: &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; And I remember walking out of the Market Tavern and him, sort of, getting into his BMW and driving off to Clapham and he had this beautiful three-storey house in Clapham. Having dinner with him, staying with him and getting to know him for the next three years. And then, I mean for two years&hellip; We were, it was always a sort of open relationship. We saw each other. He wanted more, but he was ten years older. And for me it was noticeable. And he had done very well in comparison financially. But then&hellip; So I never felt like I could be in a relationship because I just felt like we couldn&rsquo;t be equal. And that&rsquo;s the way it was and we accepted it. But we had brilliant times together, it was amazing. Then he was diagnosed in the early part of &lsquo;94. And he was really worried because we had had unprotected sex a couple of times. It wasn&rsquo;t always but it had happened. And so he was diagnosed with HIV and so I had my test and it came back negative, so it was like, well&hellip; And then he&hellip; That sort of brought us, in an odd way, closer together and, yeah, just being together with him was so special at that point. And he asked me to go on holiday with him to India. He was going to go and have a two-week holiday to India and I just, it wasn&rsquo;t just taking a holiday I needed to get the work off time, time off work and I was like, didn&rsquo;t really, dunno. Just didn&rsquo;t go. His photograph&rsquo;s up there on top of the shelf unit.
</p>
<p>
 When he came back from India he had picked up a bug and&hellip; With having the HIV he just couldn&rsquo;t fight the bug.
</p>
<p>
 And so within six months he had died. And it was&hellip; Bizarre, because it was like he was fine, he was looking like that when he went on holiday and he came back and he just started to get sicker and sicker and he was like 6-foot-2, big guy, about thirteen stone. And I pretty much&hellip; He had a long-term partner for eleven years, Terry, who he had businesses with and pretty much Terry and I looked after him for the last six months. And I remember just him sort of deteriorating in that six months and particularly in the last three months being in-and-out of hospital but in the last three months a friend of his came over from Paris to see him and he asked me if I would drive him back to Heathrow, his friend and take him with him, so I was like: &ldquo;Yeah, okay.&rdquo; Nice BMW. That&rsquo;s cool. So we got Patrice out, into the car and we drive off to Heathrow, dropped his friend off and we were driving back into London. Beautiful sunny day and we&rsquo;d got club music on and he was like, wound the windows down and he was like: &ldquo;You can go faster.&rdquo; And I think I was doing about sixty and he was like: &ldquo;You can go- .&rdquo; &ldquo;Yeah, I am, it&rsquo;s the speed limit!&rdquo; And he was like: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, you can go faster, it&rsquo;s my car.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m like: &ldquo;Yeah and I&rsquo;m driving.&rdquo; And he&rsquo;s like: &ldquo;Go faster!&rdquo; I was like: &lsquo;Oh, fuck it.&rsquo; Doing about 80. Completely breaking the speed limit but he was laughing and smiling and it was brilliant. Turned the music up. And got him back to the house and he was exhausted. He couldn&rsquo;t even get out of the car so, at that point, I mean, I think he weighed about six stone. Maybe 8, I dunno. I could pick him up in my arms anyway. So I picked him up, out of the car and I carried him up the couple of steps into the house and I mean it was all I could do to to carry him. And then sat him on the steps and a couple of his friends were coming &lsquo;round for a cup of tea. And so he sat on the sofa in his lounge and they turned up and I made tea and we just chatted and stuff. But they stayed for about half an hour. And he was so upset because they just came in, sort of, I mean they felt.. They didn&rsquo;t really know what to do but they were his long-term friends and they just sort of chatted, had a cup of tea, and passed the time of day and didn&rsquo;t really know what to say and off they went. And then I helped him get upstairs, put him to bed, got into bed with him, and just sat in bed with him and that day he gave me &ndash; he said I want to give you some stuff to remember me by &ndash; so he gave me the bracelet that I showed you. And it was, that was in I think October &lsquo;94 and he gave me that photograph and he wrote on the back of it &lsquo;As a memory to Andy, October &lsquo;94.&rsquo; And then he died probably a few weeks later in the November. And that was the last time he ever went out, bar going in to hospital. But I remember like going into hospital and he&rsquo;d be there for a few days and then he&rsquo;d come home for a few days and then he&rsquo;d be back again and the last period he was in I just, you know, he was at the point where they were putting catheters in and stuff&hellip; Yeah, the drip wouldn&rsquo;t work, so they&rsquo;d have to find a new place and you know, it was on his legs, anywhere, anywhere in the end and every day they were just collapsing. And just sitting there and holding his hand while they were, he was in a wheelchair and they were trying to find different places. And just, yeah, just sitting with him watching this person. And at the same time I had another friend called Xavier who worked with me, with us really. He worked, he was a barman in the bar that we &ndash; I say &lsquo;we&rsquo; because my best friend Francis was manager and I was the assistant manager &ndash; but Xavier was Spanish and he&rsquo;d been diagnosed, he was a, through drug, through heroin. So, there was this weird time of two people. He was okay but getting sicker. And he died sort of in &lsquo;95, so within a twelve-month period. And I was, you know, many people lost lots of friends but, for me that was, two people.
</p>
<p>
 &hellip; and with Patrice I remember his&hellip; Terry phoning me and saying, you know: &ldquo;Would you&hellip; Patrice has asked to see you.&rdquo; And I went to see him, he was like sitting up and he was bubbly and he was like&hellip; I said to Terry: &ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo; I rang him afterwards and said: &ldquo;He was great.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;Yeah I know.&rdquo; And he said: &ldquo;But yesterday he was so bad.&rdquo; And then that evening I got a phonecall to say he&rsquo;d died. And it was a bit like he&rsquo;d mustered up all this energy &hellip; And it was really difficult because at the end it was like, you know, the family who, he had lived here for a long time so, you know, but his family were sort of like arguing over stuff, what was going to happen and, you know, it all got quite messy from what I knew. And then we had the service here in London and he was cremated. And I remember, I did go to the chapel of rest to see him in, in&hellip; Just by the Chelsea &amp; Westminster Hospital because that&rsquo;s where he was, so, you know. And actually it was when Chelsea &amp; Westminster Hospital had just opened up, so, for him to go into hospital it was at, sort of like&hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t like, it wasn&rsquo;t like what it was for many people in the very early period it was just like, you know&hellip; But I remember, this is what? &lsquo;94? Dunno. But I remember going into the ward and it was like there was people in the beds all around him and they would be, you&rsquo;d walk in and it would be like that person had died and another person had died and they&rsquo;d been replaced and then another person had died and it was that sort of&hellip; It was just the way it was and you didn&rsquo;t really&hellip; It seemed so busy and so just in-and-out and in-and-out. But, you know, then going to see him from that point and him being sort of skeletal, to going to see him in the chapel of rest which was really odd because it was just like&hellip; Because his family hadn&rsquo;t seen him, they had filled him and put him back to his normal weight and made him look&hellip; So, I was totally freaked out, because I got used to seeing this ill person, to suddenly there he was in one of his suits and padded and make-up on his face to make him look as well as possible, because his parents didn&rsquo;t want to see him how he was.
</p>
<p>
 It was the most bizarre thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I was just like, and I thought, I mean I had to walk out because I thought I was in the wrong room. And then it was like, and I looked, and then that was really odd because I had to look because I was now in there with this person and then I was just like: &lsquo;I have to leave.&rsquo; And then afterwards, they took his ashes back to France and I have no idea where he is because I have no connection with his family, nothing at all. And yet he&rsquo;s such a big part of my life as&hellip; the impact of my diagnosis in 2008 and why I just felt, like, you know, when I got the diagnosis I was going to die, because of what I&rsquo;d seen in the hospital and what I&rsquo;d experienced with him.
</p>
<p>
 That was what I saw and then with Xavier who died twelve months later. And, you know, how we supported him and worked with him and you know, &lsquo;cause he just wanted to be as normal as possible for as long as possible. Even at the end of Xavier&rsquo;s time in at work, Francis and I used to do his shifts for him so he could come to work but he would sit at the bar and we would work for him, just so he could feel as, you know, he could be there and stuff, until the point when it got too much for him to come in.
</p>
<p>
 And I remember having, going to his flat once to see him as well. And having a lovely conversation because he was, you know, so sort of, the whole Spanish side of&hellip; Being much more open and far less conservative than the British, and sort of English, whatever, and him sort of saying: &ldquo;Andy, just stop worrying so much, I just&hellip; All I want for you is to just stop being so afraid, in a way. Just be you. And live your life. Get on with it. Enjoy it. Take anything from this, it&rsquo;s just like live your life.&rdquo; And that was a beautiful afternoon I spent with him as well. In his flat. And I&rsquo;m so glad that I did. Yeah. There we go.
