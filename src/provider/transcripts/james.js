My name&rsquo;s James Ward and I live in Leeds and I&rsquo;ve been living with HIV since 1996.
</p>
<p>
When I think of home, I think of Yorkshire probably, primarily. I&rsquo;m Yorkshire born-and-bred and the Yorkshire Dales always makes my heart sing. Doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t have a global outlook, but home has always felt, I think, like somewhere in Yorkshire. And I guess I&rsquo;m quite a homely person in terms of just liking and taking pleasure in kind of small domestic things like, y&rsquo;know, cooking and spending time with people and noticing the sunlight coming in the windows and quite small things like that.
</p>
<p>
To make me feel like home I think it&rsquo;s changed because I used to think it was tied to a specific house and I&rsquo;ve moved a lot over the past couple of years and I know now it&rsquo;s not tied to a specific house. It must be something else, because I&rsquo;ve felt at home everywhere I&rsquo;ve been. I&rsquo;ve moved four times in the past three years. So home, for me, it isn&rsquo;t about possessions really &lsquo;cause I don&rsquo;t have that many possessions, but it&rsquo;s just something about it being&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know actually, I&rsquo;m going to have to think about this. Yeah&hellip; Let me think about this. What does home mean to me? What do I need to make home? Hm. It&rsquo;s a really good question! I&rsquo;m finding it really hard actually to put my finger on what it is. &lsquo;Cause as I say I did think it was to do with a particular construction of bricks and mortar and that was home. And then I moved from there to somewhere else and it was a real wrench to begin with and then the new place was home but I actually didn&rsquo;t stay there long because I left the person I was with and then rented somewhere just for eight months and that felt like home and then the owners of that property came back so I moved again and now this place feels like home. Home is where I am, I think. I think it&rsquo;s just wherever I am actually feels like home.
</p>
<p>
Objects and smells that feel like home&hellip; A friend of mine who &ndash; during the first COVID lockdown &ndash; I bubbled with a guy I was seeing at the time and a joint friend of ours and even though the law didn&rsquo;t permit social bubbles at the point &lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re three queers who would have been completely isolated and that just didn&rsquo;t seem fair or reasonable to expect anyone to live through a COVID lockdown like that. And so we spent a lot of time here and I think it was a very special time actually for all three of us in terms of growth and learning about ourselves and learning about each other and one of my friends, after he&rsquo;d been away and come back, he said: &ldquo;Ah, it smells like home, it smells like James&rsquo; home.&rdquo; So I think, I think certainly smell and smelling like me, is a thing. I guess in terms of objects, the only objects I really take with me are my kitchen equipment, which is important to me &hellip; and&hellip; I guess, yeah, they&rsquo;re probably the most important objects! I made a decision along time ago to not keep anything unless it was beautiful or practical and so all my kitchen things are practical and a lot of them are quite beautiful as well. So, when I move I don&rsquo;t -. I have a few pictures, I have a few books, I have my clothes and then all my kitchen stuff, so they&rsquo;re important to me. But again, I think, what I&rsquo;ve learned is even if they weren&rsquo;t with me&hellip; I think I&rsquo;d very&hellip; that not actually that necessary, &lsquo;cause it does feel like home is wherever I kind of set my head for the night.
</p>
<p>
I think my relationship with home probably became more important after my diagnosis. So I was diagnosed in &lsquo;96 and didn&rsquo;t need or certainly wasn&rsquo;t offered treatment for a long time because up until four-or-five years ago treatment was only offered when your CD4 count had dropped to a level that indicated a risk from opportunistic diseases. And so I, I lived for about twenty years with this sense that I was a bit of a medical miracle. I didn&rsquo;t need to think about HIV. It wasn&rsquo;t having any impact. I didn&rsquo;t really feel like it was ever going to do anything bad to me and so I think I kind of deluded myself a bit that it wasn&rsquo;t affecting me but actually my.. My world did shrink a lot and I was a lot less outgoing and&hellip; And in fact I remember the first time after my diagnosis and I met somebody and we went away &ndash; just for a weekend together and it was only down to Cornwall &ndash; and I remember really having a strong sense of feeling quite adventurous and brave and it was only a weekend and I was really happy to get home. So I think home, during certainly the first years of my diagnosis, was really important. That&rsquo;s the only place I wanted to be. As the years went by &ndash; and certainly since I&rsquo;ve become undetectable; I started on treatment a few years ago and become undetectable &ndash; then I&rsquo;m very happy to not be at home. But I do like home, yeah I do like home a lot actually! Thinking about my responses to these questions I do like being at home and when I&rsquo;ve been away, I do like coming home.
</p>
<p>
So, I was diagnosed in &lsquo;96 and that was the point at which combination therapy &ndash; as they called it then &ndash; was first coming on-stream, but my CD4 count&hellip; For some reason my body, you know there are a percentage of people living with HIV whose bodies manage to keep the virus under control for much longer than other people. So the progression of HIV with me was very slow and my CD4 count &ndash; which is what they measure every three-to-six months &ndash; was very high so no treatment was offered until a few years ago when the treatment guidelines changed, but I was incredibly closeted about my status. And I didn&rsquo;t realise until after I started my treatment and become undetectable, that was when I started to realise just how ashamed I felt for all those years about my status. I had definitely taken on board&hellip; You know, I grew up in the &lsquo;80s, so in the &lsquo;80s the media, school, Government, the Church, everybody said it was a gay disease and it was your own fault. And I think I felt an enormous amount of guilt. I felt guilty that my parents might have to one day face me dying before them, which isn&rsquo;t the normal course of things. I felt guilty about any risks of transmission to other people. Not only did I have HIV I was co-infected with hepatitis, so&hellip; And that came a few years after the HIV and that came about because I was seeing a guy who was also positive and so we made a joint decision not to use condoms and he told me about his hepatitis-B status, he&rsquo;d been completely honest. I knew my vaccine hadn&rsquo;t really worked despite a number of extra boosters, so it was nobody&rsquo;s responsibility but mine, but I think the guilt of getting a second, potentially-terminal sexually-transmitted disease was just like: &lsquo;What the fuck is wrong with you?&rsquo; You know? And I, and I didn&rsquo;t think I could actually trust myself to, to put other people at risk so really sex became very problematic until the treatment guidelines changed. The treatment guidelines changed because they realised not only is the prognosis better regardless of how the disease is progressing earlier treatment is better and more so because you can&rsquo;t pass it on, so the benefits of u-equals-u and treatment as prevention. So, I started treatment the day after the Brexit referendum and it was, it was&hellip; That decision was laden with anxiety and I felt really low and it felt like a one-way door I didn&rsquo;t want to go through and it felt like I was giving up this medical miracle status that I thought I was getting lots of benefit from but what I hadn&rsquo;t recognised was the benefits of becoming undetectable and even more so the benefits of embracing the idea and that meant it was untransmittable. And that didn&rsquo;t happen until I started volunteering for Positively UK and training to be a peer mentor and on that course, it was I think a two-and-a-half day course, and I think they spent at least half a day going through all the evidence for u-equals-u and that evidence goes back far further than I understood. I thought, when I first heard about u-equals-u, I thought it was something they had just worked out and maybe it was true but surely it couldn&rsquo;t be true and it just seemed too incredible to believe. But when they spent that day going through study after study after study after study where they&hellip; it all pointed to u-equals-u being true and they just needed enough data to say: &lsquo;No, we will assert this.&rsquo; And that day on that course was what finally convinced me that u-equals-u, and from that point on it was just a very rapid unlocking of all this negativity that I&rsquo;d been carrying for so long.
</p>
<p>
So, I read a book called The Velvet Rage and The Velvet Rage talks primarily about how lots of gay guys grow up internalising the shame that&rsquo;s put upon them by a kind of CIS, male, patriarchal society and they try and overcompensate for the unfairness of what society says is wrong about them by overcompensating in other ways and that might be overachieving at work or being the best-dressed person or having the most sex, or, y&rsquo;know, all sorts of different ways, some of them healthy, some of them not healthy, but a kind of railing against the injustice of growing up gay in a straight, CIS world. But, the book&rsquo;s interesting enough but the key part of that book was in his introduction where he talks about how the shame of having HIV is just a thousand-fold and it&rsquo;s: &lsquo;Oh my god, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been feeling for twenty years! I&rsquo;ve just been ashamed. How blind was I? How simple was this? I&rsquo;ve been feeling ashamed. And I&rsquo;ve no reason to feel ashamed. Since the age of sixteen when I came out I&rsquo;ve been campaigning on the streets, I&rsquo;ve been on TV programmes talking about being gay, I&rsquo;ve been on the front cover of Gay Times, I&rsquo;ve been in the Evening Post, you know, I&rsquo;ve done a lot a lot of campaigning around my sexuality on the basis that just living life openly and proudly and not feeling &ndash; I&rsquo;ve never felt ashamed of being gay, not a day of shame about being gay actually. Even when I was thirteen, my first awareness that I was gay, and people starting to pick on me at school, my response was just to wear loads of makeup and go selling Avon door-to-door, you know, it was&hellip; I was not going to accept anybody else&rsquo;s shame projected onto me, I was going to give back a hundred-fold whatever they were laying on me and&hellip; And then, but I never&hellip; At the back of my mind over these twenty years: &lsquo;Why does HIV feel so different? Why, I&rsquo;d never&hellip; I&rsquo;d barely told anybody and if I did it was my tone of telling them. I remember it would be a very kind of confessional way of telling people and, as I say, I did the peer mentoring course with Positively UK, I read this book, I became undetectable, and that combination of things was just so liberating and such a positive experience and so now I&rsquo;m completely straightforward, y&rsquo;know, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s barely anyone I know close enough to know my sexuality who doesn&rsquo;t also know about HIV and&hellip; And I think it&rsquo;s&hellip; I think and I hope it&rsquo;s been helpful to other people living with HIV. I&rsquo;ve been approached by people on a dance floor, somebody came up to me and he just said: &ldquo;I just want to tell you, you know, I&rsquo;ve got HIV,&rdquo; and he was only diagnosed a year-or-two earlier and he said, y&rsquo;know: &ldquo;To see someone just being comfortable and proud and at ease with the diagnosis was massively helpful,&rdquo; and I said: &ldquo;Well, good, because that&rsquo;s what I hoped.&rdquo; And I did a big coming out on Facebook, it was World AIDS Day 2017 and I decided to write quite a long essay on there about my story and I was just so overwhelmed with the responses I got, which were just so supportive and people just so surprised that&rsquo;s&hellip; You know, particularly straight people who perhaps aren&rsquo;t so tuned in to issues around sexuality, were so upset to hear that I&rsquo;d been having such a tough time and that, the truth feels, it was all self-inflicted. Yes, there&rsquo;s a lot of stigma, of course there&rsquo;s a lot of stigma. There&rsquo;s a lot of stigma amongst general society, there&rsquo;s just as much stigma among the gay community, y&rsquo;know guys on Grdr who ask if you&rsquo;re clean and rubbish like that, but the worst stigma that I experienced was self-inflicted. And now it&rsquo;s gone.
</p>
<p>
After my diagnosis I didn&rsquo;t feel overtly excluded from spaces, but I felt like I wasn&rsquo;t entitled to be happy. And I wasn&rsquo;t entitled to enjoy sex. It felt like I was guilty of something and that therefore invalidated me from any entitlement to see myself as an okay person. So I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s excluded me, but as I say I think the worst impact of any negativity around my diagnosis came from inside, not outside. I mean, in the very early days, I remember my&hellip; I&rsquo;d moved house and I joined a new GP practice and I thought: &lsquo;Oh, I might as well tell them, they&rsquo;re my healthcare professionals, they ought to know everything about my diagnosis.&rsquo; And this practice was, I think, used to dealing with replacement hips and more elder-care issues than a young gay guy who presents with an HIV-diagnosis. So, the GP gave me an appalling response, he looked shocked and then bumbled and stumbled with his words and said: &ldquo;Ah, ah, well, well, I understand now why you&rsquo;re not bothered about stopping smoking.&rdquo; As in, you know, you&rsquo;ll be dead soon anyway. And then he said: &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re a homosexual I take it? Either that or a drug taker, which is it?&rdquo; I was like: &lsquo;Jesus&hellip;&rsquo; So, erm, so that was not great. But since I was so closeted about my status, as I say, I think any exclusion that occurred I pre-empted it myself. But I do remember feeling like, like an outsider again and that&rsquo;s so much a common experience of being completely queer. And it felt like I was an outsider from my own community in a way, because it must be&hellip; well, the way I saw it is: &lsquo;I liked getting fucked bareback and that makes me a bad person because bad gays don&rsquo;t use condoms, good gays do use condoms. And therefore I&rsquo;m a bad person and therefore this disease I&rsquo;ve got, which I could pass on to someone else, I&rsquo;m entirely responsible for and I&rsquo;m responsible for every bad thing that happens in the world.&rsquo; So, yeah&hellip; And yeah, that all came from that shame. And self-imposed stigma. Because it was interesting when I became undetectable and when I finally accepted that it did mean that it was untransmittable and it did mean that actually I could have whatever kind of sex I wanted and there was no risk to me because I&rsquo;ve already got HIV and there was no risk to anyone else because I can&rsquo;t pass it on, it still felt like I was being somehow devious or somehow getting away with something, like for my own ends and still being irresponsible, so it did take even a little while to get over that final sense of guilt that I&rsquo;d carried around HIV. But once I did, I&rsquo;ve had a great time. And now I sometimes share my status, I sometimes don&rsquo;t share my status. Sometimes use condoms, sometimes don&rsquo;t use condoms, and it took me a long time to feel comfortable with the idea of not sharing my status and not using a condom and that being okay, that took me a long time to accept. And I think some people still do find that shocking. I&rsquo;ve had conversations with other queer people who look taken aback and it&rsquo;s like: &lsquo;well, if I&rsquo;ve got diabetes it&rsquo;s just as transmittable as that. Do I need to tell somebody, do I need to tell a hook-up I&rsquo;ve got diabetes?&rsquo; Literally, it&rsquo;s as transmittable. And in fact more than that there&rsquo;s no safer sex than having sex with somebody who&rsquo;s undetectable. Condom or no condom. You can use PREP, but that&rsquo;s not a hundred percent. You can use condoms but if the other person isn&rsquo;t undetectable, condoms are not 100% effective, you know. The only safe sex is somebody who knows their status and is on treatment and is undetectable, so it&rsquo;s taken me&hellip; It took me, it was like layers of shame and guilt to get rid of and now I have got rid of them.
</p>
<p>
I do think a lot of people have a kind of gut feeling that if you&rsquo;re positive there&rsquo;s a duty to share your status, so that they then have a choice. And in most things in life I do believe that people should be provided with information they need to make a choice that they&rsquo;re comfortable with. So for a long time I was like: &lsquo;I should tell people my status and then it&rsquo;s up to them if they want to have sex or not.&rsquo; And if I&rsquo;m not wanting to share my status that&rsquo;s &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m wanting to get away with something. I&rsquo;m wanting to deny them their agency. Just because I&rsquo;m greedy and I want this thing so I&rsquo;m gonna be greedy and deny them the opportunity. And on one level you could say that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing. But on another level why should the onus be on the person who&rsquo;s positive to take responsibility for this situation, you know? Everybody should be responsible for their own sexual health. And if somebody chooses to have a hook-up and they choose not to use a condom, particularly if they haven&rsquo;t even asked the question about status, they&rsquo;ve made choices. And they&rsquo;re going to make those choices with somebody who doesn&rsquo;t know their status and isn&rsquo;t undetectable and is a risk who, even if the conversation took place it wouldn&rsquo;t help because if you don&rsquo;t know your status, you don&rsquo;t know your status. So that last bit of this sense of &lsquo;I&rsquo;m being somehow greedy or trying to get something I&rsquo;m not entitled to by not sharing my status and not giving them the option to opt out&rsquo;, that stayed with me a long time but when I kinda broke it down it just comes back to a sense that I&rsquo;m somehow guilty. I&rsquo;m a bad person for having this virus. I&rsquo;m guilty. I&rsquo;m responsible. I shouldn&rsquo;t be entitled to have nice things because I&rsquo;m a bad boy, kind of thing. And at the end of the day it is as transmittable as diabetes. And I ain&rsquo;t gonna tell you about that when we have a hook-up, so what&rsquo;s the problem? If the chance of transmission is nil&hellip; But I think that&rsquo;s the thing, a lot of people don&rsquo;t actually believe the chance of transmission is nil, I think most people &ndash; and I understand this &ndash; I think most people think: &lsquo;Surely, surely it can&rsquo;t be that effective?&rsquo; But it is. And the entire global medical community says&hellip; the evidence we need here is this is not true. We need evidence that transmission has occurred, not the other way around because it just hasn&rsquo;t&hellip; So, I mean, just fairly recently actually, I had sex with somebody, we&rsquo;d been using condoms, in the end he decided to take it off and we carried on and I didn&rsquo;t stop him and then afterwards, after he&rsquo;d cum, he said: &lsquo;Oh, are you on PREP or anything?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Well, better than that actually, I&rsquo;m on treatment so it&rsquo;s like even safer than if I were on PREP.&rdquo; And he was really taken aback, he said: &ldquo;You should have told me.&rdquo; And I went through the whole thing: &ldquo;Well, if I had diabetes, should I tell you that?&rdquo; You know blah blah blah&hellip; And, you know, it didn&rsquo;t make for a comfortable discussion. But I&hellip; Morally, ethically, legally, I feel entirely comfortable with that choice, you know? And as I explained to him, it&rsquo;s like: &ldquo;You asked this question at a funny time, you know. You have responsibility here. If the answer to that question was important to you, you have a duty to have asked it sooner. Why is it my responsibility?&rdquo; Just in the middle of sex to interrupt it and &lsquo;oh, time out! Can I just say&hellip;&rsquo; you know and go into some deep conversation about HIV and u-equals-u. That&rsquo;s a passion killer, right? For everybody. And, and again, it&rsquo;s like somebody might listen to me saying this and think: &lsquo;Well, you should. You greedy, selfish, you know&hellip; Immoral person. Actually, you should do that.&rsquo; And I think that&rsquo;s&hellip; He wasn&rsquo;t aggressive with me or angry, he was taken aback, but&hellip; If the science says it&rsquo;s untransmittable, then it&rsquo;s untransmittable. If the risk of transmission is nil, yeah we could have stopped and had that conversation. What difference would it have made? It wouldn&rsquo;t have made him any safer than we were anyway, so&hellip;
</p>
<p>
For him to feel comfortable, he&rsquo;s relying on me telling the truth, that I am on treatment. He&rsquo;s relying on me taking that treatment every day, or most days. He&rsquo;s relying on the science, that says if the treatment is adhered to and you are undetectable you will stay undetectable. You know he is&hellip; I understand how from his point of view he&rsquo;s relying on a lot of things and it has taken away from him that agency because it is all now dependent on me being truthful, but as I say he chose a funny time to ask. Just after he&rsquo;d cum inside me, it&rsquo;s like: &lsquo;well, c&rsquo;mon!&rsquo; If this was important to you, you would have stopped and asked the question sooner, or you would have kept that condom on. You took that condom off, not me. So&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I think men are very very good at delegating responsibility for their own sexual health and the consequences of the sex they want to have onto somebody else. I think men are very very good at that. Whether that&rsquo;s straight men or even particularly gays who are tops, you know, they want a particular kind of sex but they want to not be responsible for any consequences of that. I mean, thinking about condoms and something I hadn&rsquo;t thought about &lsquo;til fairly recently actually, and I was listening to some very interesting interviews, yeah&hellip; Condom-use for gay guys, the cultural shift that that, you know, I wasn&rsquo;t sexually active when HIV was first discovered and people started first giving the message about using condoms for sex, &lsquo;cause I was born in &lsquo;71 so HIV got here in &lsquo;81, but I was sort of becoming&hellip; It was my teenage years, you know the tombstone ad was in &lsquo;87 when I was 16 which is the year I came out. So I don&rsquo;t remember sex with men, I wasn&rsquo;t having sex with men before condoms was a message, but just thinking about it condoms were seen as pregnancy prevention, so for gay guys they had as much use for condoms as they had for sanitary prevention. I mean, it was just&hellip; They had no use for it. And then of course, you know, there was a need for it because there was few other means other than abstinence of protecting yourself. And then I think culturally we became so wedded to this notion that you&rsquo;re a good gay by using condoms and you&rsquo;re a bad gay if you don&rsquo;t use condoms. And the fact is, in my experience, the majority of people would prefer to have sex without condoms. And... but because they feel bad about that they want to delegate the responsibility of that onto somebody else, so, you know... If they end up having sex without a condom and I didn&rsquo;t share my status then that&rsquo;s my fault. Like, no. You were the one who didn&rsquo;t want to use a condom. You have, you have responsibility here. But yeah, I think, even now you look at&hellip; There&rsquo;s people arguing against PREP being available. You know PREP took so long to be available on the NHS and there were gay guys arguing that PREP shouldn&rsquo;t be made available because it will encourage people to stop using condoms. There&rsquo;s so much kind of moralising going on in there about trying to make people feel bad for not using condoms. And yeah of course, if... condoms don&rsquo;t just protect against HIV. Condoms are effective prevention against lots of STIs. But most other STIs are quite treatable and if the health service wasn&rsquo;t underfunded it would be a lot easier to get tested more regularly. It&rsquo;s not a moral dilemma. It&rsquo;s a practical one, I think, and a personal one. And I think as a community gay guys are struggling with notions of guilt and responsibility and morality around condom use and I don&rsquo;t find that helpful.
</p>
<p>
The diagnosis did effect a lot of relationships. I lost a very good friend, very early on because she&hellip; When I got my diagnosis I just didn&rsquo;t know how to respond. So I told a few people but I was as much looking to them for their response to guide me as to how I should feel, but of course they were looking to me for my response to guide them as to how they should feel, like none of us knew what to do with this information. And this&hellip; You know, she was my best friend, I&rsquo;m fairy godmother to her daughter, who I do still see, but this friend of mine, Yvonne, who&rsquo;s sadly now died through completely different causes, but&hellip; She was so upset and we sort of didn&rsquo;t&hellip; Neither of us knew kind of what to do and it did destroy the friendship actually. We just, we just overnight stopped being friends. It was quite bizarre and dramatic. But I would say that since I&rsquo;ve been open about my status, my friendships have improved. The friendships I had have improved because I&rsquo;m not carrying around this guilty secret and I&rsquo;ve got lots more new friends. Just because being ashamed of something is not a route to happiness. So when you throw away shame, you feel happier. When you feel happier you&rsquo;re gonna get more friends because you&rsquo;re more open and optimistic to life. So, I think as I say my world became quite small for the twenty years before I was open about my status but since I&rsquo;ve become open about my status it&rsquo;s transformed life.
</p>
<p>
You know, people talk about the gay community or the queer community&hellip; If I&rsquo;m part of a community I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a queer community. In my definition of queerness, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what your sexuality is. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what&rsquo;s between your legs. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter what your pronouns are. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter who you choose to have sex with. For me, queerness is something that can transcend all of those things and it&rsquo;s more to do with a state of mind and it, so I believe &ndash; controversially, to some of my friends &ndash; that you can be CIS and straight and still be queer, in my opinion. I don&rsquo;t think it has to be defined because it&rsquo;s&hellip; For me, it&rsquo;s something about recognising that... Not just that it&rsquo;s okay to be gay, that it&rsquo;s okay to be trans, but those are things to be celebrated. There&rsquo;s something about the joy you take in somebody being authentic. And I think queerness, for me, is allowing yourself and those around you to be authentic. And that authenticity isn&rsquo;t fixed, either, you know. Somebody can move around, so&hellip; You might identify as gay very strongly and then decide, you know, you&rsquo;re going to go with somebody of the opposite sex. Or you might for a long time live as CIS and then discover that your sexuality, your gender isn&rsquo;t quite so straightforward. And that can move constantly throughout life and the ability to explore that and to express that and for that to all be embraced and celebrated, for me is what queerness is and so if I&rsquo;m part of a community I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m part of a queer community.
</p>
<p>
Isn&rsquo;t one of the points of queerness is, you know, that labels are useful but&hellip; And I think labels are especially useful as we&rsquo;re trying to establish that being CIS and being straight and being male, these things are not goals to be aspired to and ideally we would get to a point where actually does it even matter that you know somebody&rsquo;s gender? Or that you know somebody&rsquo;s sexuality? Surely a very aspirational place to get to would be that we&rsquo;re all just people and we&rsquo;re people who are multi-faceted and multi-dimensional and can change and should change and grow. But I understand that, for now, labels do matter but then when people get stuck on feeling that when somebody&rsquo;s label makes them feel uncomfortable, like there&rsquo;s an odd biphobia and there always has been and there still is a lot of biphobia as if somehow that isn&rsquo;t a legitimate way. Well, which is it? You need to pick. Like: what are you doing? Like hedging your bets or being greedy. I mean all this bullshit and just, it&rsquo;s inexplicable to me. But since I&rsquo;ve become much more confident about my HIV status and transformed my life and started going out more, I&rsquo;ve started&hellip; A lot of my social circle are people in their twenties and that is so deeply refreshing to see how much that generation get stuff like this in all the way that my generation didn&rsquo;t. And don&rsquo;t have an issue with somebody&rsquo;s pronouns changing or somebody&rsquo;s name changing or somebody&rsquo;s sexuality being fluid and undefined and changeable. There&rsquo;s a new&hellip; And you know it&rsquo;s wrapped up around issues of race as well, you know, that generation I think has a much more sophisticated understanding of race and racism and its origins and its impact, than my generation did. You know, my generation had a very simplistic, shallow and ill-informed understanding of racism, but you look at what&rsquo;s going on around, you&rsquo;ve got the BLM stuff in th past couple of years and the dialogue is just so much more useful I think. So that&hellip; I get a lot from hanging around people in their twenties. I&rsquo;ve learned and grown so much by&hellip; I&rsquo;m fifty now and most people when they get to my age seem to behave as if they know it all and the younger people need to look up to them and learn and I see it the complete opposite. I get to the age of fifty and I think: &lsquo;I need to look at younger people to learn.&rsquo; Like, I don&rsquo;t think you ever stop learning in life and yeah, when you&rsquo;re young you&rsquo;re gonna to learn from people older than you but the older you get you should be looking to the people younger than you. I think that&rsquo;s a lifelong process of, you know&hellip; You&rsquo;re not going to learn anything by thinking that you know it all.
</p>
<p>
I think I feel safe most of the time and I think that comes a lot from my white, male privilege. And my cis privilege. And that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve only fairly recently come to actually recognise and understand. I think for a long time I was very caught up in my identity as a gay man and thinking of the bullying I experienced as a child and the bullshit that I put myself through around my HIV status, so I was very much focused on how society had failed me by not being able to take those facets of me on board. I now see that actually my whiteness, my maleness and my cisness do far more for me than any harm I experience through homophobia. I mean homophobia is undoubtedly less prevalent now than it was in the &lsquo;80s, you know the &lsquo;80s&hellip; If you think about the way trans people are treated today, that&rsquo;s how gay people were treated in the &lsquo;80s. But if you &ndash; and I think quite a lot of gay guys are still very invested in being victims &ndash; and I just think it&rsquo;s really time that gay guys realise that they actually need to be standing up on behalf of other people who are now living through what I lived through when I was a teenager. You know, you look at press headlines and the discussion around trans and non-binary people&rsquo;s existence and their right to exist and their lives and you could almost replace the words &lsquo;trans&rsquo; with &lsquo;gay&rsquo; and you would be exactly what the headlines were in the &lsquo;80s. And as I say, I, so&hellip; Do I have a safe space? I think as a cis, white, gay man I have a lot of safe spaces. I think the whole world is quite safe actually for me. And therefore it&rsquo;s the responsibility for people like me to use that to stand up for people for whom they aren&rsquo;t as many safe spaces.

I honestly, until the past couple of years I really hadn&rsquo;t &ndash; particularly around whiteness &ndash; I hadn&rsquo;t understood how much I viewed whiteness as normal. And then everything that wasn&rsquo;t white was different. And therefore racism was something experienced by other people which was done by people who weren&rsquo;t me, therefore I haven&rsquo;t got anything to contribute here and now I realise that just whiteness in itself is racism. The fact that I saw whiteness as the norm and was so kind of brainwashed by growing up in a white supremacist society and white supremacist world. I just hadn&rsquo;t understood that. I&rsquo;ve understood that because of the people that I hang around with now who are in their twenties who are just so much more aware of this stuff in a way that I wasn&rsquo;t when I was that age. You know I grew up completely brainwashed about, about how what a harmful thing whiteness is in the world. How much damage whiteness has done in the world and how if you are white you are benefiting from that. You might not have designed it, it goes back hundreds of years, you might not have put this all in place but I sure as hell benefit from it and therefore I can&rsquo;t opt out of being part of trying to fix it, like that&rsquo;s not okay and I think I just opted out of thinking much about race issues. As I say, I didn&rsquo;t perceive myself to be a racist person and I wasn&rsquo;t suffering racism so it&rsquo;s kind of &lsquo;that&rsquo;s your thing, it&rsquo;s not mine,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s not okay.

How would I describe myself? Well, I guess I know how I&rsquo;d like to be described! Is that an acceptable answer? I hope I am a kind, thoughtful, energetic person who takes interest in life, but also somebody who is very headstrong and stubborn and has strong opinions that are very weakly held. And that&rsquo;s probably a big facet of my character: strong opinions, weakly held.
