      &lsquo;We Are Still Here&rsquo; is a project that cannot live without its
      participants. Therefore we want to invite you to share your narrative and
      experience about HIV/AIDS and help create more a diverse perception about
      living with the virus. We also welcome all of those within the
      HIV-negative world who have been affected or those of you who have
      questions. We are still here and we are everybody. We are only the
      beginning. Inclusivity is a journey and itâ€™s something you can help
      navigate.
